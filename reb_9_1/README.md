This problem was adapted from the 2022 Class 10 Activity. The rate expression used to generate the data was

r = k*CA*CB/CZ**2 with k = 14 M^-0.5^ min^-1^

This is not the rate expression the problem asks to be tested, so the recommendation should be to try a different rate expression that includes dependence on CZ.
