The liquid-phase reaction between A and B, equation (1), is irreversible. At the conditions of interest in this assignment, the heat of reaction is constant and equal to -101.2 kJ mol^-1^. The rate expression is given in equation (2), where the rate coefficient exhibits Arrhenius temperature dependence with a pre-exponential factor of 5.11 x 10^4^ L mol^-1^ s^-1^ and an activation energy of 74.8 kJ mol^-1^.

Two solutions, one containing only reagent A at 180 °C and one containing only reagent B at 180 °C, are charged to an adiabatic BSTR producing 1900 L of solution initially containing 2.9 mol A L^-1^ and 3.2 mol B L^-1^ at 180 °C. The solution is ideal and has a constant heat capacity of 1.23 cal g^-1^ K^-1^ and a constant density of 1.02 g cm^-3^. Plot the concentrations of A, B, Y, and Z, the reacting fluid temperature, and the instantaneous reaction rate for the first 2 h of reaction, and comment upon the shapes of the graphs.
