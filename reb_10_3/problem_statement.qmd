In @sec-example_10_2, kinetics data for reaction (1) that had been generated in a steady-state, isothermal PFR were used to assess the accuracy of a power-law rate expression. In those experiments the same amount of catalyst, 3.0 g, was present in the reactor, forming a small packed bed. The apparent density of the catalyst bed was constant, and pressure drop across the catalyst bed was negligible. The inlet volumetric flow rate was also the same in all experiments and equal to 0.85 L min^-1^ at standard temperature and pressure. The inlet mole fractions of A, B, Y, and Z were varied in the experiments and the partial pressure of A at the reactor outlet was recorded. Use the data for a block of experiments at 400 °C presented in that example to assess the accuracy of the mechanistic rate expression shown in equation (2). The equilibrium constant, $K$, in equation (2) can be calculated from available thermodynamic data. At 400 °C the value of $K_1$ is 12.2.

$$
A + B \rightarrow Y + Z \tag{1}
$$

$$
r = \frac{kP_{A}P_{B}}{1 + K_AP_A + K_BP_B + K_YP_Y + K_ZP_Z }\left( 1 - \frac{P_YP_Z}{K_1P_AP_B} \right) \tag{2}
$$
