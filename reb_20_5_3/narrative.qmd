The liquid-phase disproportionation of reagent A, reaction (1), is reversible. Kinetics data were generated in a 3 gal CSTR by varying the volumetric flow rate and the feed concentrations of reagents A, Y, and Z from experiment to experiment. In each experiment the outlet concentration of reagent A was measured. One of the constant temperature blocks of data is presented below; use it to assess the accuracy of the rate expression shown in equation (2). Note that thermodynamic data to calculate the equilibrium constant for reaction (1) are not available, so both the forward and reverse rate coefficients in the rate expression must be estimated from the experimental data.
