The liquid-phase disproportionation of reagent A, reaction (1), is reversible. Kinetics data were generated in a 3 gal CSTR by varying the temperature, volumetric flow rate and feed concentrations of reagents A, Y, and Z from experiment to experiment. In each experiment the outlet concentration of reagent A was measured. Use the resulting data, linked below, it to assess the accuracy of the rate expression shown in equation (2). Note that thermodynamic data to calculate the equilibrium constant for reaction (1) are not available, so both the forward and reverse rate coefficients in the rate expression must be estimated from the experimental data.
