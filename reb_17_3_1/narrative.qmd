In liquid phase reaction (1) the chiral molecule, Z, is produced auto-catalytically according to the rate expression given in equation (2). In the absence of the product, Z, the reaction rate is very small. The heat of reaction is -14 kcal mol^-1^, independent of temperature. The pre-exponential factor is equal to 4.2 x 10^15^ cm^3^ mol^-1^ min^-1^ and the activation energy is 18 kcal mol^-1^. A solvent is used, and the heat capacity of the reacting solution can be taken to equal that of the solvent, 1.3 cal cm^-3^ K^-1^. The density of the liquid may be assumed to be constant. The concentrations of A and Z in the feed to the process are 2 M and 0 M, respectively, and the flow rate is 500 cm^3^ min^-1^ at 300K. An adiabatic recycle PFR with a recycle ratio of 1.3 is used. The reactor diameter is 5 cm and it is 50 cm long. What are the outlet concentrations of A and Z and the outlet temperature from the process?
