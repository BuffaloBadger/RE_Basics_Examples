The water-gas shift, equation (1), is exothermic, $\Delta H$ = –9120 cal mol^-1^, and reversible. The equilibrium constant can be approximated using equation (2) with $K_{0,1}$ = 0.132. The heat capacities of CO, H~2~O, CO~2~, H~2~, and inert, I, can be take to be constant and equal to 29.3, 34.3, 41.3, 29.2, and 40.5 J mol^-1^ K^-1^, respectively. Two packed bed reactors in series are used to process a feed consisting of 1 mol CO h^-1^, 0.359 mol CO~2~ h^-1^, 4.44 mol H~2~ h^-1^, 0.180 mol I h^-1^, and 9.32 mol H~2~O h^-1^ at 26 atm and 445 °C. The volume of the first packed bed is 685 cm^3^, and it is packed with a high-temperature catalyst for which the rate is given by equation (3) with $k_{0,1}$ = 0.0354 mol cm^-3^ min^-1^ atm^-2^ and $E_1$ = 9740 cal mol^-1^. The product stream leaving the first packed bed passes through a heat exchanger. Chilled water at 20 °C flowing at a rate of 1100 g/h enters the other side of the heat exchanger and exits the heat exchanger at 50 °C The volume of the second packed bed is 3950 cm^3^, and is packed with a low-temperature catalyst for which the rate also is given by equation (3), but  with $k_{0,1}$ = 1.77 x 10^-3^ mol cm^-3^ min^-1^ atm^-2^ and $E_1$ = 3690 cal mol^-1^. Pressure drop in the reactors is negligible. What are the overall conversion of CO and the temperature of the product gas leaving the second packed bed reactor?
