An incompressible liquid at 20 Â°C containing 5 kmol m^3^ each of reagents A and B is going to be used as the feed to a non-ideal tubular reactor. The liquid has a constant heat capacity of 1.7 cal g^-1^ K^-1^ and a constant density of 0.65 g cm^-3^. Reaction (1) will take place within the reactor. The rate expression for the reaction is shown in equation (2) where the rate coefficient exhibits Arrhenius temperature depedence with a pre-exponential factor of 2.65 x 10^6^ m^3^ kmol^-1^ s^-1^ and an activation energy of 15 kcal mol^-1^. The heat of reaction (1) is -7500 cal mol^-1^. The reactor is 15 m long with a diameter of 0.1 m, and it will operate adiabatically with negligible pressure drop. The liquid will be fed to the reactor at a rate of 0.1 L min^-1^. Plot the profiles of the temperature and the concentration of A for a PFR and for the axial dispersion model with the dispersion coefficients shown in the table below. Additionally indicate on the graphs the outlet temperature and concentration of A for a CSTR of equal volume.
