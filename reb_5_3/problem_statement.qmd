Suppose that iodopropane disproportionates to produce iodine according to the apparent non-elementary reaction (1). By separately assuming each of the three mechanistic steps proposed in equations (2) through (4) to be rate-determining, generate three possible mechanistic rate expressions for reaction (1).

$$
2 C_3H_5I \rightleftarrows C_6H_{10} + I_2 \tag{1}
$$

$$
C_3H_5I \rightleftarrows C_3H_5 \cdot + I \cdot \tag{2}
$$

$$
C_3H_5I + I \cdot \rightleftarrows C_3H_5 \cdot + I_2 \tag{3}
$$

$$
2C_3H_5 \cdot \rightleftarrows C_6H_{10} \tag{4}
$$
