The gas-phase dimerization of A, reaction (1), takes place in an ideal steady-state PFR. The reaction is first order in A, equation (2). The heat of reaction (1), $\Delta H_1^0$, and the heat capacities of A, $\hat C_{p,A}$, A~2~, $\hat C_{p,A_2}$, and I, $\hat C_{p,I}$ may be assumed to be constant. The reactor has a diameter, $D$, and length $L$, and operates with negligible pressure drop. The feed to the reactor is 50% A and 50% I, an inert gas, flowing with a volumetric flow rate of $\dot V_{in}$ at a temperature of $T_{in}$ and pressure of $P$. A liquid coolant flows into the reactor shell at a temperature, $T_{ex,in}$, with a mass flow rate, $\dot m_{ex}$. It has a mass-specific heat capacity of $\tilde C_{p,ex}$. The shell volume is $V_{ex}$ and the heat transfer coefficient is $U$.
