This is not an example of a reactor analysis; it simply illustrates how to solve a set of IVODEs when all of the initial values are known. Equations (1) through (6) with the initial values, $n_{A,0}$ = $n_{B,0}$ = 190 mol, $n_{Y,0}$ = $n_{Z,0}$ = 0, $T_0$ = 450 K, and $P_0$ = 7 atm, and the final value, $t_f$ = 2 h, are representative of a set of IVODEs that an engineer might generate during the analysis of an adiabatic BSTR. For this illustration we will assume that the engineer knows the constant values of the following quantities: $V$ = 2 m^3^, $\Delta H_1$ = -3470 cal mol^-1^, $\hat{C}_{p,A}$ = 7.5 cal mol^-1^ K^-1^, $\hat{C}_{p,B}$ = 8.5 cal mol^-1^ K^-1^, $\hat{C}_{p,Y}$ =  12.1 cal mol^-1^ K^-1^, $\hat{C}_{p,Z}$ =  5.7 cal mol^-1^ K^-1^, $k_{0,1}$ = 83.0 m^3^ mol^-1^ h^-1^, and $E_1$ = 10.2 kcal mol^-1^, as well as the rate expression, equation (7).
