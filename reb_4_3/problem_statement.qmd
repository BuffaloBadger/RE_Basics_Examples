The growth rate of a certain microbial cell line is accurately represented by the Monod equation with $\mu _{max}$ equal to 1 h^-1^ and $K_s$ equal to 0.2 g L^-1^. Plot the specific growth rate *vs*. the mass concentration of substrate over a sufficiently wide range of concentrations to show all limiting behavior. Describe the asymptotic behavior mathematically *and* in terms of what is happening physically.
