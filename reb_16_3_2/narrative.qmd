An adiabatic PFR with a volume of 4 m^3^ will be used to process 1.25 mol s^-1^ of an equimolar gas phase mixture of A and B at 300 K and 2.5 atm. This feed will be pre-heated using the product stream from the reactor. The heat of reaction is constant and equal to -9,800 cal mol^-1^. The heat capacity of the gas is constant and equal to 25.8 cal mol^-1^ K^-1^. Pressure drop in the reactor is negligible. The heat transfer area multipled by the heat transfer coefficient U~AM~A = 13.6 cal K^-1^ s^-1^. What will the final conversion equal if reaction (1) takes place with a rate given by equation (2) with the pre-exponential factor equal to 2.83 x 10^4^ s^-1^ and the activation energy equal to 12,000 cal mol^-1^.?
