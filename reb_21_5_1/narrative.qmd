The gas-phase decomposition of reagent A, reaction (1), was studied at 1500 K and 1 atm using a PFR with a diameter of 1.0 cm and a length of 10 cm. The inlet volumetric flow rates of reagents A, Y, and Z, in standard cm^3^ min^-1^, were varied from experiment to experiment. In all experiments the outlet conversion of reagent A was measured. The data are presented below. Using those data, estimate the best value for the rate coefficient, $k$, in equation (2) and assess the accuracy of the resulting rate expression.
