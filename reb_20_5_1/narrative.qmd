The liquid-phase reaction between reactants A and B, reaction (1), was studied in a 100 cm^3^ laboratory CSTR. The reactor operated at steady state, the volumetric flow rate and the inlet concentrations of each of the reagents were adjusted from one experiment to the next, and the steady-state outlet concentration of reagent Y was measured. Use the experimental data to assess the accuracy with which the rate expression shown in equation (2) describes the rate of reaction (1).
