This is a kinetics data analysis assignment. It describes reactor experiments, provides the resulting data and asks me to assess a rate expression. Here I will solve it using a response function, so I need to identify the experimentally adjusted inputs and the measured response. At the same time, I can summarize the other information provided in the problem statement.

**Reactor**: PFR

**Given**: $P=1\text{ atm}$, $D=1\text{ cm}$, $L=10\text{ cm}$, and $T=1500\text{ K}$.

**Adjusted Inputs**: $\underline{\dot{V}}_{A\text{(STP)},in}$, $\underline{\dot{V}}_{Y\text{(STP)},in}$, and $\underline{\dot{V}}_{Z\text{(STP)},in}$.

**Experimental Response**: $\underline{f}_A$.

**Rate Expression Parameters**:  $k$.

The purpose of the response function is to solve the reactor design equations for each experiment and use the results to calculate the predicted value of the response. The reactor used here is a PFR. The reactor operated isothermally, and there is no mention of pressure drop, so I don't need a momentum balance, and I can solve the mole balance design equations separately from the energy balances. The mole balance design equation for a steady-state, PFR with only one reaction taking place is given in @eq-pfr_mole_bal_one_reaction.

$$
\frac{d \dot n_i}{d z} =\frac{\pi D^2}{4}\nu_{i}r
$$

Since there are three reagents in this system, I need to write a mole balance for each of them. Noting that the stoichiometric coefficients are $\nu_A = -1$, $\nu_Y = 1$, and $\nu_Z = 1$ leads to equations (3) through (5). The design equations are initial value ordinary differential equations (IVODEs) with the molar flow rates as the dependent variables and the axial position as the independent variable. I can define $z=0$ to be the inlet to the reactor. The initial values needed to solve the IVODEs are the molar flow rates of A, Y, and Z at the inlet. I can use $\dot{n}_{A,in}$, $\dot{n}_{B,in}$, and $\dot{n}_{Z,in}$, to represent those inlet molar flow rates. The reaction stops at the end of the reactor, so the stopping criterion is $z=L$.

:::

**Reactor Model**

Mole balances on A, Y, and Z are shown in equations (3), (4), and (5). The initial values and stopping criterion needed to solve them are given in @tbl-example_11_1_initial_values

$$
\frac{d\dot{n}_A}{dz} = -\frac{\pi D^2}{4}r \tag{3}
$$

$$
\frac{d\dot{n}_Y}{dz} = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}r \tag{4}
$$

$$
\frac{d\dot{n}_Z}{dz} = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}r \tag{5}
$$

| Variable | Initial Value | Stopping Criterion |
|:-------|:-------:|:-------:|
| $z$ | $0$ | $L$ |
| $\dot{n}_A$ | $\dot{n}_{A,in}$ |  |
| $\dot{n}_Y$ | $\dot{n}_{Y,in}$ |  |
| $\dot{n}_Z$ | $\dot{n}_{Z,in}$ |  |

Before I can solve the mole balance IVODEs, I need to go through the equations, initial values and stopping criterion, and any equations that will be substituted into them, and express every quantity that appears in them in terms of known constants, the independent variable and the dependent variables. Within the response function, the values of the adjusted inputs and the rate expression parameter will be know and constant, so I don't need expressions for them. I can see that when the rate expression, equation (2), is substituted into the mole balances it will introduce the partial pressure of A, so I need an expression for that. I am given the inlet (standard) volumetric flow rates of the reagents, so I'll need to calculate the molar flow rates at the inlet, too.

For the partial pressure of A, I can just use the defining equation, @eq-partial_pressure_open. The volumetric flow rates given in the assignment are volumetric flows at standard temperature and pressure (STP). The molar volume of an ideal gas at STP, $\hat{V}_\text{ STP}$, is a known constant, e. g. 22.4 L mol^-1^.

**Ancillary Equations**

$$
P_A = \frac{\dot{n}_A}{\dot{n}_A+\dot{n}_Y + \dot{n}_Z}P \tag{6}
$$

$$
\dot{n}_A\Big\vert_{z=0} = \dot{n}_{A,in} = \frac{\dot{V}_{A\text{(STP)},in}}{\hat{V}_{\text{ STP}}} \tag{7}
$$

$$
\dot{n}_Y\Big\vert_{z=0} = \dot{n}_{Y,in} = \frac{\dot{V}_{Y\text{(STP)},in}}{\hat{V}_{\text{ STP}}} \tag{8}
$$

$$
\dot{n}_Z\Big\vert_{z=0} = \dot{n}_{Z,in} = \frac{\dot{V}_{Z\text{(STP)},in}}{\hat{V}_{\text{ STP}}} \tag{9}
$$

At this point within the response function, the mole balance design equations can be solved to find the values of the dependent variables, $\dot{n}_A$, $\dot{n}_Y$, and $\dot{n}_Z$, at the reactor outlet. Those results then must be used to calculate the predicted value of the response. In this study, the response was the fractional conversion of A, which can be calculated using the definition of fractional conversion, @eq-conversion_def_open.

:::

**Response Calculation**

$$
f_A = \frac{\dot{n}_{A,in} - \dot{n}_A}{\dot{n}_{A,in}} \tag{10}
$$

**Response Function**

The response function is created with the following structure:

* The adjusted inputs, $\underline{\dot{V}}_{A\text{(STP)},in}$, $\underline{\dot{V}}_{Y\text{(STP)},in}$, and $\underline{\dot{V}}_{Z\text{(STP)},in}$, and the rate expression parameter, $k$, are passed to it as arguments.
* Variables are defined and assigned the values of all known and given quantities: $P=1\text{ atm}$, $D=1\text{ cm}$, $L=10\text{ cm}$, and $T=1500\text{ K}$.
* A function that evaluates the derivatives in the design equations given values of the independent variable, $z$, and the dependent variables, $\dot{n}_A$, $\dot{n}_Y$, and $\dot{n}_Z$, is defined. It
    * Calculates $P_A$ using equation (6).
    * Calculates $r$ using equation (2).
    * Evaluates and returns the values of the derivatives, equations (3) through (5).
* For each experiment, the response function 
    * Calculates $\dot{n}_{A,in}$, $\dot{n}_{B,in}$, and $\dot{n}_{Z,in}$ using equations (7) through (9).
    * Solves the design equations using the initial values and stopping criterion in @tbl-example_11_1_initial_values to find $\dot{n}_A$, $\dot{n}_Y$, and $\dot{n}_Z$ at $z=L$.
    * Calculates $f_A$ using equation (10).
* The values of $f_A$ for all of the experiments are returned.

**Calculations**

1. Pass the response function, the adjusted inputs, and the experimental responses to parameter estimation software to find $k$, the uncertainty in $k$, and the coefficient of determination, $R^2$.
2. Use the resulting value of $k$ to create a parity plot ($F_{A,\text{ expt}}$ *vs*. $F_{A,\text{ model}}$) and residuals plots ($F_{A,\text{ expt}} - F_{A,\text{ model}}$ *vs*. $\dot{V}_{A,in}$, *vs*. $\dot{V}_{Y,in}$, and *vs*. $\dot{V}_{Z,in}$,)

**Results**

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
d <- read.csv(paste0(path_to_results, 'reb_11_1_results.csv'))
d <- fmt_tibble_col(d, 2, 3, 2, 2)
a <- c('k','R^2^')
b1 <- paste0(d$value[1],' ',d$units[1],', 95% CI [',d$value[2],', ',d$value[3],']')
b <- c(b1,d$value[4])
d <- data.frame(a,b)
```

To estimate $k$, the response function as described above was passes to parameter estimation software along with the adjusted experimental inputs, the measured experimental responses, and a guess for $k$. The results returned by that software are shown in @tbl-example_11_1_results.

```{r}

#| warning: false

```

A parity plot and residuals plots were generated as described above, and are shown in @fig-example_11_1_plots

By all criteria, the rate expression appears to be very accurate. The coefficient of determination is close to 1.0, the upper and lower limits of the 95% confidence interval for $k$ are very close to the value of $k$, the points in the parity plot are all very close to the diagonal line, and in each of the residuals plots the scatter is random with no apparent trends.

:::

**Assessment**

When the rate coefficient in @tbl-example_11_1_results is used in the proposed rate expression, it is acceptably accurate. The data do not indicate any functional dependence of the rate upon the paritial pressures of Y or Z.
