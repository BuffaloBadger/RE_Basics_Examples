This is a kinetics data analysis assignment. I will solve it using a response function, since that method can always be used. Within the response function the adjusted inputs and the rate expression parameters will be available. I'll start by summarizing the information provided in the assignment.

:::

**Reactor**: BSTR

**Given**: $V=50 \text{ ml}$.

**Adjusted Inputs**: $\underline{C}_{S,0}$ and $\underline{t}_{rxn}$

**Experimental Response**: $\underline{C}_P$

**Rate Expression Parameters**: $V_{max}$, and $K_m$

All of the data in this problem were generated at the same temperature, so they can all be analyzed together. I need to write a reactor model (see @sec-3_design_eqns), use it to create a reactor response function (see @sec-3_response_func and above), and use that to fit the reactor model to the experimental data (see [Appendix -@sec-apndx_parameter_est]).

For an isothermal reactor, the mole balances can be solved independently of the other reactor design equations. In this problem there are three reagents, the substrate S, the product P, and water. However, as the assignment notes, the concentration of water is essentially constant, so I don't need a mole balance on it. I will use @eq-bstr_mole_bal_one_reaction, reproduced below, to write mole balance on reagents S and P, noting that their stoichiometric coefficients are -1 and 1, respectively. 

$$
\frac{dn_i}{dt} = \nu_i r V
$$

Those mole balances are IVODEs, so I need initial values and a stopping criterion to solve them. Letting $t=0$ be the time when the reaction started (presumably when the enzyme was added to a solution of substrate), then the stopping criterion for each experiment is $t=t_{rxn}$. I will let $n_{S,0}$ represent the molar amount of substrate at $t=0$. The assignment states that product P was not present at $t=0$.

:::

**Reactor Model**

Mole balances on the substrate S and the product P are presented in equations (3) and (4). The associated initial values and stopping criterion are listed in @tbl-example_9_4_initial_values.

$$
\frac{dn_S}{dt} = -rV \tag{3}
$$

$$
\frac{dn_P}{dt} = rV \tag{4}
$$

| Variable | Initial Value | Stopping Criterion |
|:-------|:-------:|:-------:|
| $t$ | $0$ | $t_{rxn}$ |
| $n_S$ | $n_{S,0}$ | |
| $n_P$ | $0$ | |

Within the response function  I will need to solve the design equations numerically. The design equations are IVODEs. The independent variable is $t$ and the dependent variables are $n_S$ and $n_P$. In order to solve those IVODEs numerically I need to go through the design equations, initial values and stopping criterion and express every quantity that is in them, or that gets subtituted into them, in terms of known constants, the independent variable and the dependent variables. The adjusted inputs, $\underline{C}_{S,0}$ and $\underline{t}_{rxn}$, and the rate expression parameters, $V_{max}$, and $K_m$, will be available.

When the rate expression, equation (2) is substituted into the design equations it will introduce the concentration of S. The defining equation for concentration in a closed system, @eq-concentration_closed, can be used to express the concentration of S in terms of the molar amount of S.

The initial molar amount of S is not provided in the assignment, either, but the initial concentration is. Consequently, the definition of concentration can be used to calculate the initial molar amount of reagent S.

So in summary, I need ancillary equations to calculate $C_AS$ and $n_{S,0}$, using known constants, $t$, $n_S$, and $n_P$.

:::

**Ancillary Equations**

$$
C_S = \frac{n_S}{V} \tag{5}
$$

$$
n_{S,0} = C_{S,0}V \tag{6}
$$

Once the design equations have been solved within the response function, the predicted value of the response variable must be calculated and returned. Solving the design equations will yield the values of $n_S$, $n_P$, and $n_{H_2O}$ at times between $t=0$ and $t=t_{rxn}$. I can use the definition of concentration and the molar amount of produce P at $t=t_{rxn}$, $n_{P,f}$, found by solving the design equations to calculate the response, $C_P$.

:::

**Response Calculation**

$$
C_P = \frac{n_{P,f}}{V} \tag{7}
$$

**Response Function**

The response function is created with the following structure:

* The adjusted inputs, $\underline{C}_{S,0}$ and $\underline{t}_{rxn}$, and the rate expression parameters, $V_{max}$, and $K_m$, are passed to it as arguments.
* A variables is defined and assigned the value of the known quantity, $V=50 \text{ ml}$.
* A function that evaluates the design equations given values of the independent variable, $t$, and the dependent variables, $n_S$ and $n_P$ is defined. It
    * Calculates $C_S$ using equation (5).
    * Calculates $r$ using equation (2).
    * Evaluates the derivatives, equations (3) and (4).
* For each experiment the response function
    * Calculates $n_{S,0}$ using equations (7).
    * Solves the design equations using the initial values and stopping criterion in @tbl-example_9_4_initial_values to find $n_S$ and $n_P$ at $t_{rxn}$.
    * Calculates $C_P$ at $t_{rxn}$ using equation (8).
* The values of $C_P$ for all of the experiments are returned.

Having created the response function, I can now use it to estimate the rate expression parameters, $V_{max}$, and $K_m$. To do so I will use parameter estimation software of my choosing. I will write a simple program that passes the adjusted inputs, the measured responses, and a guess for the rate expression parameters to that parameter estimation software. It will return the best estimates for $V_{max}$, and $K_m$, some measure of the uncertainty in $V_{max}$, and $K_m$, and the coefficient of determination, $R^2$.

Using the resulting values of $V_{max}$, and $K_m$, I can calculate the model-predicted responses for all of the experiments using the response function. Then, knowing the model-predicted responses I can calculate the residual (difference between the measured response and the model-predicted response) for each eperiment. Finally, as described in @sec-4_kin_data_gen, I can create a parity plot and residuals plots.

:::

**Calculations**

1. Pass the response function, the adjusted inputs, and the experimental responses to parameter estimation software to find $V_{max}$, and $K_m$, the uncertainty in $V_{max}$, and $K_m$, and the coefficient of determination, $R^2$.
2. Use the resulting values of $V_{max}$, and $K_m$ to create a parity plot ($C_{P,\text{expt}}$ *vs*. $C_{P,\text{model}}$) and residuals plots ($C_{P,\text{expt}}$ - $C_{P,\text{model}}$ *vs*. $C_{S,0}$ and *vs*. $t_{rxn}$).

**Results**

d <- fmt_tibble_col(d, 2, 3, 2, 2)
a <- c('V~max~','K~m~','R^2^')
b1 <- paste0(d$value[1],' ',d$units[1],', 95% CI [',d$value[2],', ',d$value[3],']')
b2 <- paste0(d$value[4],' ',d$units[4],', 95% CI [',d$value[5],', ',d$value[6],']')
b <- c(b1,b2,d$value[7])
 # item, value, units
d <- data.frame(a,b)
```

To estimate the kinetics parameters, the response function described above was passed to parameter estimation software along with the adjusted experimental inputs, the experimental responses and a guess for the kinetics parameters. The results returned by that software are shown in @tbl-example_9_4_results.

A parity plot of the measured responses *vs*. the model-predicated responses is presented in @fig-example_9_4_parity, and residuals plots showing the difference between the measured and predicted responses *vs*. the initial concentration of S and *vs*. the reaction time are shown in @fig-example_9_4_residual.

The proposed model is quite accurate. Looking at the parity plot, the deviations of the data from the diagonal line is very small, and in the residuals plots, the deviations are random with no apparent trends. The difference between the upper and lower limits of the 95% confidence intervals are small relative to the estimated values of $V_{max}$, and $K_m$, and the coefficient of determination is nearly equal to 1.0.

:::

**Assessment**

When the rate coefficient shown in @tbl-example_9_4_results is used in the proposed rate expression, equation (2), the rate expression is acceptably accurate.

:::{.callout-note collapse="false"}
## Note

Had there been data for other temperatures, the analysis presented above would have been repeated for each block of same-temperature data to find values of $V_{max}$, and $K_m$ at that temperature. Then the Arrhenius expression would have been fit to the resulting $V_{max}$ *vs*. $T$ and $K_m$ *vs*. $T$ data.
