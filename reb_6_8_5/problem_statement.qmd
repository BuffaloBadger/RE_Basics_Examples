The gas-phase dimerization of A, reaction (1), and its degradation to Z, reaction (2), take place simultaneously in an ideal steady-state PFR. The reactor operates with negligible pressure drop. A liquid coolant flows into the reactor shell at a constant mass flow rate and known temperature, and leaves the shell as a liquid. Write and simplify the reactor design equations needed to model this system.

$$
2 A \rightarrow A_2 \tag{1}
$$

$$
A \rightarrow Z \tag{2}
$$
