The gas-phase decomposition of A according to reaction (1) takes place at steady-state in a PFR. The feed to the reactor is 75% A and 25% inert gas flowing at 100 cm^3^ s^-1^ (0.44 g s^-1^) at 3 atm and 400 °C. The reactor diameter is 2.5 cm and its length is 8 m. It is surrounded by a shell containing a molten salt at a constant temperature of 375 °C. The heat transfer coefficient between the reactor and shell is 187 kJ h^-1^ m^-2^ K^-1^. The reaction is catalytic, and the reactor is packed with catalyst particles with a 0.25 cm diameter, a sphericity of 0.7, and a bed porosity of 0.60.
The rate expression for reaction (1) is given in equation (2) where $k_{0,f}$ = 9.0 x 10^17^ mol cm^3^ s^-1^ atm^-1^ , $𝐸_𝑓$ = 285 kJ mol^-1^, $𝑘_{0,𝑟}$ = 4.09 x 10^-4^ mol cm^-3^ s^-1^ atm^-4^, and $𝐸_𝑟$ = 85 kJ mol^-1^. The heat of reaction is constant and equal to 200 kJ mol^-1^. The heat capacities of the reagents are also constant: $\hat{C}_{P,A}$ = 11.7 cal mol^-1^ K^-1^, $\hat{C}_{P,Y}$ = 8.3 cal mol^-1^ K^-1^, $\hat{C}_{P,Z}$ = 4.3 cal mol^-1^ K^-1^, and $\hat{C}_{P,I}$ = 5.8 cal  mol^-1^ K^-1^. The viscosity may be assumed to be constant and equal to 0.027 cP.
