A reaction engineer has been given an assignment (see [Example -@sec-example_17_3_1]) that requires analyzing the use of an adiabatic, steady-state, recycle PFR like that in @fig-example_K_4_1_schematic for reaction (1). The engineer summarized the assignment as shown below.

$$
A \rightarrow Z \tag{1}
$$
