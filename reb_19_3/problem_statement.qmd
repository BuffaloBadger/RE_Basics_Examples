An ideal, 100 cm^3^, isothermal BSTR was used to generate kinetics data for reaction (1) at several temperatures. In a typical experiment at any one temperature, reagent A was added to the reactor at that temperature and a pressure of $P_{A,0}$. Then, to begin the reaction, a sufficient amount of reagent B at the same temperature was added instantaneously to bring the total pressure to 6.0 atm. The reaction progress was followed by recording the total pressure once per minute for 24 min after the addition of reagent B. Use the resulting experimental data below from three experiments at 275 °C to assess the accuracy of the rate expression shown in equation (2) at 275 °C.

r = k P_A \sqrt{P_B} \tag{2}
