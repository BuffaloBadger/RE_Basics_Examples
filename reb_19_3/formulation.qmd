This is a kinetics data analysis assignment. It describes reactor experiments, provides the data from those experiments, and asks me to assess the accuracy of a proposed rate expression. I will solve it using a response function. The response function will be passed the adjusted inputs and the rate expression parameters as arguments, so I will start by summarizing the information provided in the assignment and identifying those quantities.

:::

**Reactor Type**: BSTR

**Given Constants**: $V=100 \text{ cm}^3$, $P_0=6 \text{ atm}$, $T=275\text{ °C}$.

**Adjusted Inputs**: $\underline{P}_{A,0}$ and $\underline{t_{rxn}}$

**Experimental Responses**: $\underline{P}$

**Rate Expression Parameter**: $k$

Within the response function, I'll first need to solve the reactor design equations, so I'll begin by generating the design equations and formulating their solution. Here the reactor is a stirred tank, so there isn't a momentum balance. Furthermore, the reactor operates isothermally, so I can solve the mole balance design equations independently of the energy balance design equations. For an isothermal BSTR with only one reaction taking place, the general form of the mole balance design equation is given in @eq-bstr_mole_bal_one_reaction.

$$
\frac{dn_i}{dt} = \nu_i r V
$$

This system has 3 reagents, A, B, and Z, and their stoichiometric coefficients are -1, -1, and 1, respectively. With that knowledge, I can write the mole balances. Defining $t=0$ as the instant reagent B is added and the reaction starts, I can let $n_{A,0}$ and $n_{B,0}$ represent the molar amounts of A and B present at $t=0$, noting that reagent Z is not present at that instant. The response is measured at specific times, $t_{rxn}$, so the stopping criterion is $t=t_{rxn}$.

:::

**Reactor Model**

Mole balance design equations for A, B, and Z are presented in equations (3), (4), and (5). The initial values and stopping criterion needed for solving them are given in @tbl-example_9_3_initial_values.

$$
\frac{dn_A}{dt} = -rV \tag{3}
$$

$$
\frac{dn_B}{dt} = -rV \tag{4}
$$

$$
\frac{dn_Z}{dt} = rV \tag{5}
$$

| Variable | Initial Value | Stopping Criterion |
|:-------|:-------:|:-------:|
| $t$ | $0$ | $t_{rxn}$ |
| $n_A$ | $n_{A,0}$ |  |
| $n_B$ | $n_{B,0}$ |  |
| $n_Z$ | $0$ | |

The design equations are IVODEs. The independent variable is $t$ and the dependent variables are $n_A$, $n_B$ and $n_Z$. In order to solve those IVODEs numerically I need to go through the design equations, initial values and stopping criterion and express every quantity that is in them, or that gets subtituted into them, in terms of known constants, the independent variable and the dependent variables.

The design equations will be solved within a response function so that the adjusted inputs, $\underline{P}_{A,0}$ and $\underline{t_{rxn}}$, and the rate expression parameter, $k$, will be available. When the rate expression, equation (2) is substituted into the design equations it will introduce the partial pressures of A and B. The ideal gas law can be used to calculate them. For reagent A, the initial partial pressure is an adjusted input. For reagent B, the initial partial pressure must be calculated from the initial total pressure and the initial partial pressure of A.

The initial molar amounts of A and B are not provided in the assignment, either. They also can be calculated using the ideal gas law since the assignment does provide their initial partial pressures.

Thus, I need ancillary equations to calculate $P_A$, $P_B$, $n_{A,0}$, and $n_{B,0}$ using known constants, $t$, $n_A$, $n_B$, and $n_Z$.

:::

**Ancillary Equations**

$$
P_A = \frac{n_ART}{V} \tag{6}
$$

$$
P_B = \frac{n_BRT}{V} \tag{7}
$$

$$
n_A\Big\vert_{t=0} = n_{A,0} = \frac{P_{A,0}V}{RT} \tag{8}
$$

$$
n_B\Big\vert_{t=0} = n_{B,0} = \frac{P_{B,0}V}{RT} \tag{9}
$$

$$
P_{B,0} = P_0 - P_{A,0} \tag{10}
$$

At this point, the reactor design experiments can be solved to find $n_A$, $n_B$, and $n_Z$ at $t=t_{rxn}$. Withing the response function, those results must be used to calculate the response predicted by the reactor model. The ideal gas law can be used to do that.

:::

**Response Calculation**

$$
P = \frac{\left(n_A + n_B + n_Z\right)RT}{V} \tag{11}
$$

**Response Function**

The response function is created with the following structure:

* The adjusted inputs, $\underline{P}_{A,0}$ and $\underline{t_{rxn}}$, and the rate expression parameter, $k$, are passed to it as arguments.
* Variables are defined and assigned the values of all known and given quantities, $V=100 \text{ cm}^3$, $P_0=6 \text{ atm}$, and $T=275\text{ °C}$.
* A function that evaluates the design equations given values of the independent variable, $t$, and the dependent variables, $n_A$, $n_B$, and $n_Z$ is defined. It
    * Calculates $P_A$ and $P_B$ using equations (6) and (7).
    * Calculates $r$ using equation (2).
    * Evaluates the derivatives, equations (3) through (5).
* For each experiment the response function
    * Calculates $n_{A,0}$ and $n_{B,0}$ using equations (8) through (10).
    * Solves the design equations using the initial values and stopping criterion in @tbl-example_9_3_initial_values to find $n_A$, $n_B$, and $n_Z$ at $t_{rxn}$.
    * Calculates $P$ at $t_{rxn}$ using equation (11).
* The values of $P$ for all of the experiments are returned.

Having created the response function, I can now use it to estimate the rate expression parameter, $k$, at the experimental temperature, 275 °C. To do so I will use parameter estimation software of my choosing. I will write a simple program that passes the adjusted inputs, the measured responses, and a guess for the rate expression parameter to that parameter estimation software. It will return the best estimate for $k$, some measure of the uncertainty in $k$, and the coefficient of determination, $R^2$.

Using the resulting value of $k$, I can calculate the model-predicted responses for all of the experiments using the response function. Then, knowing the model-predicted responses I can calculate the residual (difference between the measured response and the model-predicted response) for each eperiment. Finally, as described in @sec-4_kin_data_gen, I can create a parity plot and residuals plots.

:::

**Calculations**

1. Pass the response function, the adjusted inputs, and the experimental responses to parameter estimation software to find $k$, the uncertainty in $k$, and the coefficient of determination, $R^2$.
2. Use the resulting value of $k$ to create a parity plot ($P_{\text{expt}}$ *vs*. $P_{\text{model}}$) and residuals plots ($P_{\text{expt}}$ - $P_{\text{model}}$ *vs*. $P_{A,0}$ and *vs*. $t_{rxn}$).

**Results**

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
d <- read.csv(paste0(path_to_results,'reb_9_3_results.csv'))
d <- fmt_tibble_col(d, 2, 3, 2, 2)
a <- c('k','R^2^')
b1 <- paste0(d$value[1],' ',d$units[1],', 95% CI [',d$value[2],', ',d$value[3],']')
b <- c(b1,d$value[4])
 # item, value, units
d <- data.frame(a,b)
```

To estimate the kinetics parameters, the response function described above was passed to parameter estimation software along with the adjusted experimental inputs, the experimental responses and a guess for the kinetics parameters. The results returned by that software are shown in @tbl-example_9_3_results.

A parity plot of the measured responses *vs*. the model-predicated responses is presented in @fig-example_9_3_parity, and residuals plots showing the difference between the measured and predicted responses *vs*. the initial partial pressure of A and *vs*. the reaction time are shown in @fig-example_9_3_residual.

The proposed model is quite accurate. Looking at the parity plot, the deviations of the data from the diagonal line is very small, and in the residuals plots, the deviations are random with no apparent trends. The difference between the upper and lower limits of the 95% confidence interval are small relative to the estimated value of the rate coefficient, and the coefficient of determination is nearly equal to 1.0.

:::

**Assessment**

When the rate coefficient shown in @tbl-example_9_3_results is used in the proposed rate expression, equation (2), the rate expression is acceptably accurate.

## Note

In this example, data from a single same-temperature data block were analyzed. In a real-world situation, similar data blocks for other temperatures would be analyzed in the same way. The Arrhenius expression would then be fit to the resulting data. Fitting the Arrhenius expression to $k$ *vs*. $T$ data was illustrated in the first two examples in this chapter. The process here would be exactly the same as in [Examples -@sec-example_9_1] and [-@sec-example_9_2].
