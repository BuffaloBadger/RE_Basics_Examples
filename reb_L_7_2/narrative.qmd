A reaction engineer is analyzing a same-temperature block of data from an isothermal BSTR kinetics data set. The adjusted input variable is the elapsed time, $t_f$, and the experimental response is the concentration of Y, $C_{Y,\text{expt}}$. In all of the experiments the temperature was 70 Â°C, the initial concentrations of A was 1.0 M, and the initial concentration of B was 0.9 M. The engineer's assignment summary and mathematical formulation of the calculations necessary for performing the analysis are shown below. Complete the mathematical formulation of the analysis and implement it numerically.
