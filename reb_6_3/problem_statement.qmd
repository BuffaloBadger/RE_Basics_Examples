The exothermic, liquid-phase acid neutralization, reaction (1), occurs in an ideal SBSTR. The heat of reaction and heat capacity of the solution are constant. The rate is second order overall, first order in each reactant, equation (2). Initially a volume, $V_0$, of solution at temperature, $T_0$, is present in the reactor. That solution contains only B at a concentration of $C_{B0}$. To start the process another solution containing only A at a concentration of $C_{A,in}$ and a temperature of $T_{in}$ begins flowing into the reactor. The volumetric flow rate of the added solution increases linearly with time according to equation (3), where $\alpha$ is a known constant. The pressure, $P$, is constant. The reactor jacket initially contains chilled water at a temperature of $T_{ex,0}$. At the same time that the reactant solution starts flowing into the reactor, chilled water at $T_{ex,in}$ starts to flow into the jacket. The volumetric flow rate of the chilled water is constant during the process and equal to $\dot V_{ex,in}$. The reactor jacket volume is $V_{ex}$, the heat transfer area is $A$, and the heat transfer coefficient is $U$. The reactant solution flows into the reactor for a period of time, $t_f$, after which the process ends. 

$$
A + B \rightarrow S + W \tag{1}
$$

$$
r_1 = k_1 C_A C_B \tag{2}
$$

$$
\dot V_{in} = \alpha t \tag{3}
$$

Write and simplify the reactor design equations needed to model this system, including any necessary initial values and stopping criterion.
