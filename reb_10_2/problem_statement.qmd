Reversible, gas-phase reaction (1) was studied in a PFR at 1 atm and several temperatures. In all experiments the same amount of catalyst, 3.0 g, was present in the reactor, forming a small packed bed. The apparent density of the catalyst bed was constant, and pressure drop across the catalyst bed was negligible. The inlet volumetric flow rate was also the same in all experiments and equal to 0.85 L min^-1^ at standard temperature and pressure. The inlet mole fractions of A, B, Y, and Z were varied in the experiments and the partial pressure of A at the reactor outlet was recorded. Use the data for a block of experiments at 400 °C presented below to assess the accuracy of the power-law rate expression shown in equation (2). The equilibrium constant, $K$, in equation (2) can be calculated from available thermodynamic data. At 400 °C the value of $K$ is 12.2.

$$
A + B \rightarrow Y + Z \tag{1}
$$

$$
r = kP_{A}^{\alpha_A}P_{B}^{\alpha_B}P_{Y}^{\alpha_Y}P_{Z}^{\alpha_Z}\left( 1 - \frac{P_YP_Z}{KP_AP_B} \right) \tag{2}
$$
