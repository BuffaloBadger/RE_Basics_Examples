[Example -@sec-example_4_5_4] described how to estimate the Arrhenius pre-exponential factor and activation energy using a linear least squares fitting function. Show how to numerically implement the estimation of those parameters, the calculation of the upper and lower limits of their 95% confidence intervals, and the calculation of the coefficient of determination in a general way that could be used with any set of $k$ *vs*. $T$ data.
