The heat of reaction (1) is 44.8 kJ mol^-1^, and it is irreversible. The rate expression is equation (2) where the pre-exponential factor is 7.22 x 10^6^ mol atm^-2^ cm^-3^ s^-1^ and the activation energy is 84.1 kJ mol^-1^. A 10 foot long tubular reactor with a diameter of 1 inch is heated by a vapor condensing at 200 °C on the outside of the tube wall. The overall heat transfer coefficient is 7.48 x 10^4^ J h^-1^ ft^-2^ K^-1^. Pressure drop through the reactor is negligible. If a gas phase mixture of 60% A and 40% B enters the reactor at 282 L min^-1^, 2.5 atm and 175 °C and if the heat capacities of A, B and Z are equal to 18.0, 12.25 and 21.2 cal mol^-1^ K^-1^, what steady state outlet temperature and conversion of B will result?
