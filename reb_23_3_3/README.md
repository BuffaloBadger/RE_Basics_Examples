This example compares the conversion for an isothermal, steady-state, liquid-phase CSTR to the conversion for the same system modeled using the early-mixing and late-mixing segregated flow reactor models and the cumulative age distribution function for an ideal CSTR.

The reaction is second-order, so the models predict different conversions.

The discussion points out that the models will only give equal predictions when the reaction is first-order.
