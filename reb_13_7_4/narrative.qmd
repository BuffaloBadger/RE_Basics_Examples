The water-gas shift, equation (1), is used to reduce the amount of CO in gas mixtures containing CO, CO~2~, H~2~, H~2~O, and other gases. It is exothermic, $\Delta H$ = -9120 cal mol^-1^, and reversible with the equilibrium constant given by equation (3) with $K_{0,1}$ = 0.132. The heat capacities of CO, H~2~O, CO~2~, H~2~, and inert, I, can be take to be constant and equal to 29.3, 34.3, 41.3, 29.2, and 40.5 J mol^-1^ K^-1^, respectively. Two reactors are often used, one operating at higher temperatures and the other at lower temperatures. The steam to CO feed ratio is often in the range from 3 to 6. Suppose the rate in the first reactor when using a certain catalyst is given by equation (2) with $k_{0.1}$ = 0.0354 mol cm^-3^ min^-1^ atm^-2^ and $E_1$ = 9740 cal mol^-1^. The feed to the adiabatic reactor is at 26 atm and 320 Â°C, and pressure drop is negligible. Using a feed with 1 mol CO h^-1^, 0.359 mol CO~2~ h^-1^, 4.44 mol H~2~ h^-1^, and 0.180 mol I h^-1^ as a basis, what inlet molar flow of H~2~O will minimize the reactor volume if 55% of the CO must be converted? What will the outlet temperature from a reactor of that volume equal?
