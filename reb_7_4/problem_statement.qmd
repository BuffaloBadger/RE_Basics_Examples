In [Example -@sec-example_7_1] of *Reaction Engineering Basics*, a set of BSTR experiments was designed to generate kinetics data for reaction (1). The initial conditions for 12 experiments were specified in @tbl-example_7_1 of that example. In each experiment the concentration of reagent A was to be measured at six reaction times, giving a set of 72 experimental data points. Letting $i$ index the 72 experimental data points, the data set includes values for the three adjusted inputs, $T_i$, $C_{A,0,i}$, and $t_i$, and for the experimental response, $C_{A,i}$. Suppose now that the experimental data set is available to use to assess the accuracy of the first order rate expression shown in equation (2). 

$$
A \rightarrow Z \tag{1}
$$

$$
r_1 = k_{0,1} \exp \left( \frac{-E_1}{RT} \right) C_A \tag{2}
$$

Use the experimental data to find an approximate value for the rate, $r_{1,i}$, for each data point, $i$. Then describe how to use the resulting data to assess the accuracy of the rate expression, equation (2).
