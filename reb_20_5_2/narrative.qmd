Preliminary experiments have indicated that gas-phase reaction (1) is irreversible and that the rate is not affected by the concentration of the product Z. To generate kinetics data, experiments were performed at three temperatures. An ideal CSTR operating at 3 atm was used for all experiments. The feed in every experiment contained only reagents A and B. The temperature, space time, and mole fraction of A in the feed were varied from experiment to experiment, and the outlet concentration of Z was measured. The first few data are presented below. Use the full data set, linked below, to assess the accuracy of the rate expression shown in equation (2) where the power-law reaction orders, $\alpha_A$ and $\alpha_B$, must be estimated along with the rate coefficient, $k$.
