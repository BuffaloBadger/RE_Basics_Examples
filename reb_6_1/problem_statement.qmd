Gas phase reaction (1) occurs isothermally in an ideal BSTR. Initially the reactor contains only A, B, and an inert gas, I. The rate expression for gas-phase reaction (1) is given in equation (2). The rate coefficient displays Arrhenius temperature dependence.

$$
A + 2 B \rightarrow Y + Z \tag{1}
$$

$$
r_1 = k_1 C_A C_B \tag{2}
$$

Assume that the following quantities are known and constant:  the reactor volume, $V$, the initial moles of A, $n_{A,0}$, the initial moles of B, $n_{B,0}$, the initial moles of Y, $n_{Y,0}=0$, the initial moles of Z, $n_{Z,0}=0$, the initial moles of I, $n_{I,0}$, the initial temperature, $T_0$, the initial pressure, $P_0$, the pre-exponential factor, $k_{0,1}$, the activation energy, $E_1$, and the reaction time, $t_f$.

Write and simplify the reactor design equations needed to model this system and formulate their solution.
