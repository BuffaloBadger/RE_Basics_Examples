This is a kinetics data analysis problem. It describes a CSTR and experiments performed using it, provides the data from the experiments and asks me to assess a rate expression proposed for the reaction taking place during the experiments. To solve it I will need to create a response function, and that function will be passed the adjusted inputs and rate expression parameter and return predicted values of the response. To begin, I'll summarize the information provided in the problem statement, identifying those different groups of variables.

:::

**Reactor**: CSTR

**Given**: $V=100 \text{ cm}^3$ and $T=\left( 35 + 273.15 \right) \text{ K}$.

**Adjusted Inputs**: $\underline{\dot{V}}$, $\underline{C}_{A,in}$, $\underline{C}_{B,in}$, $\underline{C}_{Y,in}$, and $\underline{C}_{Z,in}$

**Experimental Response**: $\underline{C}_{Y,out}$

**Rate Expression Parameter**: $k$

I know that in kinetics data analysis problems I need to create a response function, and within that function, I need to solve the reactor model equations. Since the steady-state temperature of the reacting fluid is known, I can model the reactor using only mole balances. There are four reagents, A, B, Y, and Z, so I'll write the mole balance, @eq-cstr_mole_bal_one_reaction, for each of them. 

$$
0 = \dot{n}_{i,in} - \dot{n}_i + \nu_i r V
$$

The stoichiometric coefficients of A and B are -1 and the stoichiometric coefficients of Y and Z are +1, leading to equations (3) through (6).

:::

**Reactor Model**

Mole balances on the four reagents are shown in equations (3) through (6).

$$
0 = \dot{n}_{A,in} - \dot{n}_A - rV \tag{3}
$$

$$
0 = \dot{n}_{B,in} - \dot{n}_B - rV \tag{4}
$$

$$
0 = \dot{n}_{Y,in} - \dot{n}_Y + rV \tag{5}
$$

$$
0 = \dot{n}_{Z,in} - \dot{n}_Z + rV \tag{6}
$$

The reactor design equations are ATEs. Within the response function I will need to solve them numerically for the four outlet molar flow rates, $\dot{n}_A$, $\dot{n}_B$, $\dot{n}_Y$, and $\dot{n}_Z$. In order to solve those ATEs, I need to go through them and express every quantity that is in them or that gets substituted into them and express every quantity in terms of known constants and those 4 unknowns.

The adjusted inputs and the rate expression parameter will be available within the response function. Looking at the design equations, the volume is a known constant. The inlet molar flow rates of each reagent also appear in the design equations, so I'll need ancillary equations for calculating them from known constants and the four unknowns. When the rate expression is substituted into the design equations it will introduce the concentrations of A and B, so expressions for them will be needed, too. In all cases, I will be able to use the defining equation for concentration in an open system, @eq-concentration_open.

$$
C_i = \frac{\dot n_i}{\dot V}
$$

:::

**Ancillary Equations**

$$
\dot{n}_{A,in} = C_{A,in}\dot{V} \tag{7}
$$

$$
\dot{n}_{B,in} = C_{B,in}\dot{V} \tag{8}
$$

$$
\dot{n}_{Y,in} = C_{Y,in}\dot{V} \tag{9}
$$

$$
\dot{n}_{Z,in} = C_{Z,in}\dot{V} \tag{10}
$$

$$
C_A = \frac{\dot{n}_A}{\dot{V}} \tag{11}
$$

$$
C_B = \frac{\dot{n}_B}{\dot{V}} \tag{12}
$$

**Response Calculation**

At this point equations (3) through (6) can be solved for the outlet molar flow rates, $\dot{n}_A$, $\dot{n}_B$, $\dot{n}_Y$, and $\dot{n}_Z$. Within the response function I need to use those results to calculate the model-predicted response. In this problem the response is the outlet concentration of Y, so again @eq-concentration_open can be used.

:::

$$
C_Y = \frac{\dot{n}_Y}{\dot{V}} \tag{13}
$$

**Response Function**

The response function is created with the following structure.

* The adjusted inputs, $\underline{\dot{V}}$, $\underline{C}_{A,in}$, $\underline{C}_{B,in}$, $\underline{C}_{Y,in}$, and $\underline{C}_{Z,in}$, and the rate expression parameter, $k$, are passed to it as arguments.
* Variables are defined and assigned the values of all known and given quantities, $V=100 \text{ cm}^3$ and $T=\left( 35 + 273.15 \right) \text{ K}$.
* A function is defined that evaluates the reactor equation residuals (the right-hand sides of equations (3) through (6)), given values of the unknowns, $\dot{n}_A$, $\dot{n}_B$, $\dot{n}_Y$, and $\dot{n}_Z$. It
    * Calculates $\dot{n}_{A,in}$, $\dot{n}_{B,in}$, $\dot{n}_{Y,in}$, and $\dot{n}_{Z,in}$ using equations (7) through (10).
    * Calculates $C_A$ and $C_B$ using equations (11) and (12).
    * Calculated $r$ using equation (2).
    * Evaluates and returns the residuals, equations (3) through (6).
* For each experiment, the response function
    * Solves the reactor design equations numerically to find $\dot{n}_A$, $\dot{n}_B$, $\dot{n}_Y$, and $\dot{n}_Z$.
    * Calculates $C_Y$ using equation (13).
* The predicted values $C_Y$ for all of the experiments are returned.

Having created the response function, I can now use it to estimate the rate expression parameter, $k$, at the experimental temperature, 35 Â°C. To do so I will use parameter estimation software of my choosing. I will write a simple program that passes the adjusted inputs, the measured responses, and a guess for the rate expression parameter to that parameter estimation software. It will return the best estimate for $k$, some measure of the uncertainty in $k$, and the coefficient of determination, $R^2$.

Using the resulting value of $k$, I can calculate the model-predicted responses for all of the experiments using the response function. Then, knowing the model-predicted responses I can calculate the residual (difference between the measured response and the model-predicted response) for each eperiment. Finally, as described in @sec-4_kin_data_gen, I can create a parity plot and residuals plots.

:::

**Calculations**

1. Pass the response function, the adjusted inputs, the experimental responses, and a guess for the rate expression parameter to parameter estimation software to find $k$, the uncertainty in $k$, and the coefficient of determination, $R^2$.
2. Use the resulting value of $k$ to calculate the model-predicted response, $C_{y,\text{model}}$, for every experiment.
3. Create a parity plot ($C_{y,\text{model}}$ *vs*. $C_{y,\text{expt}}$) and parity plots ($C_{y,\text{model}} - C_{y,\text{expt}}$ *vs*. $\dot{V}_{in}$, *vs*. $C_{A,in}$, *vs*. $C_{B,in}$, *vs*. $C_{Y,in}$, and *vs*. $C_{Z,in}$,)

**Results**

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
df <- read.csv(paste0(path_to_results,"reb_10_1_results.csv"))
df <- fmt_tibble_col(df, 2, 3, 3, 2)
a <- c('k','R^2^')
b1 <- paste0(df$value[1],' ',df$units[1],', 95% CI [',df$value[2],', ',df$value[3],']')
b <- c(b1,df$value[4])
 # item, value, units
d <- data.frame(a,b)
```

To estimate $k$, the response function described above was passed to parameter estimation software along with the adjusted experimental inputs, the experimental responses and a guess for $k$. The results returned by that software are shown in @tbl-example_10-1_results.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| label: tbl-example_10-1_results
#| tbl-cap: Parameter estimation results
kbl(d, format = "markdown", align = "cc", col.names = NULL)
```

The estimated rate coefficient was used to calculate the model-predicted response for each experiment, and that was used to calculate the residual for each experiment. The results were then used to generate the parity plot and residuals plots shown in @fig-example_10_1_plots.

The 95% confidence interval for $k$, `r df$value[2]` to `r df$value[3]` `r df$units[2]`, is approximately plus or minus 7% of its estimated value, `r df$value[1]` `r df$units[1]`. There is some scatter apparent in the parity plot, and the coefficient of determination is `r df$value[4]`. These factors suggest that the rate expression is reasonably accurate. The residuals plots for $\dot{V}$ and $C_Y$ show random deviations of the residuals about zero, too. However, in the residuals plots for $C_A$ and $C_B$ the residuals at low concentration do not scatter equally about zero. The residuals for $C_Z$ show a definite trend, decreasing steadily as $C_Z$ increases. This suggests that the reaction rate may have some functional dependence on the concentration of Z that is not captured in the rate expression.

:::

**Assessment**

The rate expression is reasonably accurate, but there are indications that the rate expression may not fully capture the dependence of the rate on the concentration of reagent Z. Rate expressions that include a functional dependence on the concentration of Z should be postulated and assessed to determine whether they can represent the experimental results more accurately.

:::{.callout-note collapse="false"}
## Note

In this example, the accuracy of the rate expression is reasonable, but the indication that the rate depends on the concentration of Z is a concern. In a real-world study, there would be blocks of data at other temperatures. If the same trends were observed for each data block, the recommendation to try different rate expressions that include functional dependence on Z would be supported. If none of the other temperature blocks showed these trends, it might be recommended that the rate expression was reasonably acceptable.
