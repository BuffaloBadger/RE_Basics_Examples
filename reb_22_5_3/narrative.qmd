A tubular reactor is being used for the gas-phase decomposition of reagent A according to reaction (1). The reactor operates at steady-state using a feed that contains 75% reagent A and 25% inert gas at 3 atm and 375 °C. The feed flows into the 2.5 cm, diameter, 8 m long reactor at 100 cm^3^ s^-1^ (0.44 g s^-1^). The reactor tube is surrounded by molten salt, also at 375 °C. The heat transfer coefficient is 187 kJ h^-1^ m^-2^ K^-1^. The reactor is packed with catalyst particles that have a 0.25 cm diameter and a sphericity of 0.7. The bed porosity is 0.6. The presence of the packing causes a pressure drop along the length of the reactor.

The rate expression for the reaction is given in equation (2) where the Arrhenius pre-exponential factor and activation energy for the forward rate coefficient are 9.0 x 10^17^ mol cm^3^ s^-1^ atm^-1^ and 285 kJ mol^-1^, respectively. The Arrhenius parameters for the reverse rate coefficient are 4.09 x 10^-4^ mol cm^3^ s^-1^ atm^-4^ and 85 kJ mol^-1^. The heat of reaction is constant and equal to 200 kJ mol^-1^. The heat capacities of A, Y, Z, and I are constant and equal to 11.7 cal mol^-1^ K^-1^, 8.3 cal mol^-1^ K^-1^, 4.3 cal mol^-1^ K^-1^, and 5.8 cal mol^-1^ K^-1^, respectively. The gas viscosity is constant and equal to 0.27 cP.

If this reactor is an ideal PFR, what is its cumulative age distribution function?
