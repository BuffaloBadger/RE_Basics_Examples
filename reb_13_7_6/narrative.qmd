The gas-phase conversion of A to Z, equation (1), takes place at steady-state in a packed bed PFR operating isothermally at 400 °C. The reaction rate per unit catalyst particle volume is first order in A, equation (2), and at the operating temperature, the rate coefficient is equal to 0.15 cm^3^~fluid~ cm^3^~particle~ s^-1^. The void fraction within the packed bed is equal to 0.4. Pure A, flowing at 1.0 cm^3^ s^-1^ (0.054 g s^-1^), 400 °C, and 30 atm is fed to the reactor. There are no temperature gradients anywhere in the reactor or in the catalyst particles, and there are no concentration gradients external to the spherical catalyst particles which have a diameter, $D_p$ of 4 mm. The effective diffusion coefficient of A within the porous catalyst particles is equal to 0.0029 cm^2^ s^-1^ and the gas viscosity may be assumed to be constant and equal to 0.022 cP. If the reactor diameter is 1.5 cm and the conversion of A in the reactor is to equal 85%, what reactor length is required?
