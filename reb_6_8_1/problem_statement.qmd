Gas phase reaction (1) occurs isothermally at a known temperature in an ideal BSTR. Initially the reactor contains only known molar amounts of A, B, and an inert gas, I. The reaction ends after a known amount of time. The rate expression for gas-phase reaction (1) is given in equation (2). The rate coefficient displays Arrhenius temperature dependence.

$$
A + 2 B \rightarrow Y + Z \tag{1}
$$

$$
r_1 = k_1 C_A C_B \tag{2}
$$

Write the minimum number of reactor design equations, and the associated initial values and stopping criterion, needed to model the composition within this system over time.
