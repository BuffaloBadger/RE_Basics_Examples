A 10 gal CSTR with a 1.25 gal shell is going to be used for the conversion of A and B according to reactions (1), (2), and (3). Both the reactor and the shell are perfectly mixed. Before flow into the reactor begins, it is filled with a solution containing only B at a concentration of 3 mol gal^-1^ and a temperature of 20 째C, while the shell is filled with cooling water at 20 째C. To start up the reactor, 0.5 gal min^-1^ of a feed consisting of a liquid solution of A (7.5 mol gal^-1^) and B (3 mol gal^-1^) at 50 째C starts flowing into the reactor and simultaneously cooling water at 20 째C starts flowing into the shell at a rate of 250 g min^-1^. The heat transfer coefficient between the reactor and the shell is 190 cal ft^-2^ min^-1^ K^-1^ and the heat transfer area is 4 ft^2^. The entire process operates at a constant pressure of 1 atm. 

Each of the reactions is first order in the concentration of A and first order in the concentration of B. The pre-exponential factors, activation energies and heats of reaction are listed in the table below. The heats of reaction may be taken to be constant. The cooling water has a constant density of 1 g cm^-3^ and a constant heat capacity of 1 cal g^-1^ K^-1^. The reacting fluid may be assumed to have a constant heat capacity of 1600 cal gal^-1^ K^-1^.

Plot the temperature of the reacting fluid, the temperature of the cooling water in the jacket, and the concentration of B in the reactor during the first 30 minutes of the start-up process.
