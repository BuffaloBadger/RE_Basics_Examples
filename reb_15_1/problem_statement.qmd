A 1.2 M solution of reagent A at 80 °C and a 1.1 M solution of B at 25 °C available for the production of Y and Z via reaction (1). It is anticipated that there is a market for ? moles of Y per year. Reaction (1) is endothermic with a nearly constant heat of reaction equal to 104 kJ mol^-1^. Solutions containing A, B, Y, and or Z at these concentration levels have a heat capacity, 3 J g^-1^ K^-1^, and density, 0.87 g cm^-3^, that are essentially constant and equal to the solvent. Equation (2) is the rate expression wherein the pre-exponential factor is 2.51 x 10^18^ L mol^-1^ min^-1^, and the activation energy is 119 kJ mol^-1^.

A 5 L stirred tank is available for use 4 months out of every year, but not in one continuous stretch of time. The reactor can operate at pressures from 1 to 5 atm. It can be heated using saturated steam at 100 °C in a jacket with an overall heat transfer coefficient of 336 J s^-1^ m^-2^ K^-1^, a heat transfer area of 0.107 m^2^, and a volume of 1.7 L. The turnaround time for the reactor is 30 min.

It is relatively easy and inexpensive to separate the product, Y, from a solution containing all four reagents, while it is more difficult and expensive to recover Reagent A from such solutions. Design a process that is capable of meeting the anticipated market demand for reagent Y.

$$
A + B \rightarrow Y + Z \tag{1}

$$
r_1 = k_1C_AC_B \tag{2}
$$

This problem needs to be "adjusted"
