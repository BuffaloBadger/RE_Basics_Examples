Reversible, gas-phase reaction (1) was studied in a PFR at 1 atm and 400 °C. In all experiments the same amount of catalyst, 3.0 g, was present in the reactor, forming a small packed bed. The apparent density of the catalyst bed was constant, and pressure drop across the catalyst bed was negligible. The inlet volumetric flow rate was also the same in all experiments and equal to 0.85 L min^-1^ at standard temperature and pressure. The inlet mole fractions of A, B, Y, and Z were varied in the experiments and the partial pressure of A at the reactor outlet was recorded. Use the resulting data presented below to assess the accuracy of the power-law rate expression shown in equation (2). The equilibrium constant, $K$, in equation (2) can be calculated from available thermodynamic data, and at 400 °C it has a value of 12.2.
