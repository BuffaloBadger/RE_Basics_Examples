A 350 L adiabatic CSTR and a 350 L adiabatic PFR are going to be connected in series and used to convert reagent A according to irreversible reactions (1) and (2), where D is the desired product and U is an undesired, low-value byproduct. The feed consists of an aqueous stream containing 2.5 mol A L^-1^, flowing at a rate of 100 L min^-1^ at 38 Â°C. The liquid density may be assumed to be constant. The heat of reaction (1) is -21,500 cal mol^-1^ and that of reaction (2) is -24,000 cal mol^-1^. The heat capacity of the solution is constant and equal to 1.0 cal cm^-3^ K^-1^. The rate expressions for reactions (1) and (2) are given in equations (3), and (4), respectively. The pre-exponential factor for reaction (3) is 1.2 x 10^5^ min^-1^, and the activation energy is 9100 cal mol^-1^. The Arrhenius parameters for reaction (4) are 2.17 x 10^7^ L mol^-1^ min^-1^ and 13,400 cal mol^-1^. Compare the overall conversion of A and selectivity (mol D per mol U) for the configuration with the CSTR first to those with the PFR first.
