Gas-phase reaction (1) takes place in an ideal, adiabatic BSTR. It is irreversible and first-order in A, equation (2). The heat of reaction and the heat capacities of the reagents may be assumed to be constant. Initially the reactor contains only reagent A at a known temperature, $T_0$, and pressure, $P_0$, and the reaction proceeds until the temperature reaches $T_f$.

$$
A \rightarrow B \tag{1}
$$

$$
r_1 = k_1 C_A \tag{2}
$$

Write and simplify the reactor design equations needed to model this system, including the associated initial values and stopping criterion.
