This problem describes reactor experiments, provides the data from the experiments, and asks me to assess the accuracy of a rate expression, so it is a kinetics data analysis problem. Knowing that I will be creating a response function, I'll start by listing the reactor type, constants given in the problem statement, the adjusted experimental inputs, the experimental response, and the rate expression parameter I need to estimate.

:::

**Reactor**:CSTR

**Given**: $P = 3 \text{ atm}$ and $T = 450 + 273.15 \text{ K}$.

**Adjusted Inputs**: $\underline{\tau}$ and $\underline{y}_{A,in}$.

**Experimental Response**: $\underline{C}_Z$.

**Rate Expression Parameters**:  $k$, $\alpha_A$, and $\alpha_B$.

I need to generate a response function that predicts the responses using the rate expression. To start, I need a model for the reactor. Referring back to @sec-3_design_eqns, I know that when the reactor operates at a known temperature, the mole balances can be solved independently from the other design equations, so all I need here is a set of mole balances for this reactor. The mole balance design equation for a steady-state CSTR with only one reaction taking place is given in @eq-cstr_mole_bal_one_reaction.

$$
0 = \dot{n}_{i,in} - \dot{n}_i + \nu_i r V
$$

The stoichiometric coefficients of A, B, and Z are -1, -1 and 1, respectively. The problem also states that the feed contained only reagents A and B, so the inlet molar flow rate of reagent Z is equal to zero. Substitution of those values leads to equations (3) through (5).

:::

**Reactor Model**

Mole balances on A, B, and Z are shown in equations (3) through (5).

$$
0 = \dot{n}_{A,in} - \dot{n}_A - rV \tag{3}
$$

$$
0 = \dot{n}_{B,in} - \dot{n}_B - rV \tag{4}
$$

$$
0 = \cancelto{0}{\dot{n}_{Z,in}} - \dot{n}_Z + rV \tag{5}
$$

Within the response function I will need to numerically solve equations (3) through (5) for the outlet molar flow rates of A, B, and Z. To do that, I must provide equations for calculating every other quantity in the equations from those unknowns and known constants. So I'll go through each of the mole balances and any equations that will be substituted into them and write equations for the quantities other than the unknowns and known constants.

At first, looking at the mole balances, it appears that I'm not given sufficient information, but upon careful reading of the problem statement I see that all of the quantities provided are *intensive* quantities. When that is true, I can choose the value for one *extensive* quantity and use it as the basis for my calculations. I'm going to choose a reactor volume of 1 L as the basis for my calculations.

The mole balance design equations also contain the inlet molar flow rates of A and B. The problem statement does not provide any flow rates, but having chosen a volume as a basis, I can use the definition of space time (which is one of the adjusted inputs) to calculate the inlet volumetric flow rate. Then I can use the ideal gas law to calculate the total inlet molar flow rate and the inlet mole fractions of A and B to calculate their inlet molar flow rates.

When I substitute the rate expression into the mole balances, that will introduce the partial pressures of A and B. Equations for the partial pressures can be written using the unknowns and the defining equation for partial pressure. The rate coefficient and the reaction orders will be passed to the response function as arguments, so I don't need equations for them.

:::

**Ancillary Equations**

$$
V = 1 \text{ L }\left( \text{Basis} \right) \tag{6}
$$

$$
\dot{V}_{in} = V/\tau \tag{7}
$$

$$
\dot{n}_{in,\text{total}} = \frac{P\dot{V}_{in}}{RT} \tag{8}
$$

$$
\dot{n}_{A,in} = y_{A,in}\dot{n}_{in,\text{total}} \tag{9}
$$

$$
\dot{n}_{B,in} = \left(1 - y_{A,in}\right)\dot{n}_{in,\text{total}} \tag{10}
$$

$$
P_A = y_A P = \frac{\dot{n}_A}{\dot{n}_A + \dot{n}_B + \dot{n}_Z}P \tag{11}
$$

$$
P_B = y_B P = \frac{\dot{n}_B}{\dot{n}_A + \dot{n}_B + \dot{n}_Z}P \tag{12}
$$

At this point the mole balances can be solved numerically for the outlet molar flow rates of A, B, and Z. This will be done within the response function, and then the results must be used to calculate the response predicted by the model. In this problem the response is the concentration of Z in the stream leaving the reactor. That can be calculated using the ideal gas law, @eq-conc_cstr_kinetics.

:::

**Response Calculation**

$$
C_Z = \frac{\dot{n}_Z}{\dot{V}} = \frac{\dot{n}_ZP}{\dot{n}_{\text{total}}RT} = \frac{\dot{n}_ZP}{\left(\dot{n}_A + \dot{n}_B + \dot{n}_Z\right)RT} \tag{13}
$$

**Response Function**

The response function is created with the following structure.

* The adjusted inputs, $\underline{\tau}$ and $\underline{y}_{A,in}$, and the rate expression parameters, $k$, $\alpha_A$, and $\alpha_B$, are passed to it as arguments.
* Variables are defined and assigned the values of all known and given quantities, $P = 3 \text{ atm}$ and $T = 450 + 273.15 \text{ K}$, and the basis, equation (6).
* A function is defined that evaluates the reactor equation residuals (the right-hand sides of equations (3) through (5)), given values of the unknowns, $\dot{n}_A$, $\dot{n}_B$, and $\dot{n}_Z$. It
    * Calculates the inlet volumetric and molar flow rates, equations (7) and (8).
    * Calculates the inlet molar flow rates of A and B, equations (9) and (10).
    * Calculates the partial pressures of A and B, equations (11) and (12).
    * Calculates $r$ using equation (2).
    * Evaluates and returns the residuals, equations (3) through (5).
* For each experiment, the response function
    * Solves the reactor design equations numerically to find $\dot{n}_A$, $\dot{n}_B$, and $\dot{n}_Z$.
    * Calculates $C_Z$ using equation (13).
* The predicted values of $C_Z$ for all of the experiments are returned.

Having created the response function, I can now use it to estimate the rate expression parameters, $k$, $\alpha_A$, and $\alpha_B$, at the experimental temperature, 450 Â°C. To do so I will use parameter estimation software of my choosing. I will write a simple program that passes the adjusted inputs, the measured responses, and a guess for the rate expression parameter to that parameter estimation software. It will return the best estimate for $k$, $\alpha_A$, and $\alpha_B$, some measure of the uncertainty in $k$, $\alpha_A$, and $\alpha_B$, and the coefficient of determination, $R^2$.

Using the resulting value of $k$, $\alpha_A$, and $\alpha_B$, I can calculate the model-predicted responses for all of the experiments using the response function. Then, knowing the model-predicted responses I can calculate the residual (difference between the measured response and the model-predicted response) for each eperiment. Finally, as described in @sec-4_kin_data_gen, I can create a parity plot and residuals plots.

:::

**Calculations**

1. Pass the response function, the adjusted inputs, the experimental responses, and a guess for the rate expression parameter to parameter estimation software to find $k$, $\alpha_A$, and $\alpha_B$, the uncertainty in $k$, $\alpha_A$, and $\alpha_B$, and the coefficient of determination, $R^2$.
2. Use the resulting values of $k$, $\alpha_A$, and $\alpha_B$ to calculate the model-predicted response, $C_{Z,\text{model}}$, for every experiment.
3. Create a parity plot ($C_{Z,\text{model}}$ *vs*. $C_{Z,\text{expt}}$) and parity plots ($C_{Z,\text{model}} - C_{Z,\text{expt}}$ *vs*. $\underline{\tau}$ and *vs*. $\underline{y}_{A,in}$.

The deviations of the data points from the line in the parity plot are small, the deviations of the residuals about zero are random with no apparent trends, the coefficient of determination is close to 1, and the upper and lower limits of the 95% confidence intervals for all three parameters are close to the estimated parameter value. All of these are indicators of an accurate model.

:::

**Assessment**

When used with the rate expression parameters shown in @tbl-example_10_2_parameters, the accuracy of the proposed rate expression in describing the concentration dependence of the rate at 450 Â°C is acceptable.
