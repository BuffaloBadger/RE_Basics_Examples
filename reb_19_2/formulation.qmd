I can see that this is a kinetics data analysis problem, and as such, I know generally how to proceed (see the expert thinking callout at the start of this section). I will start by summarizing the information provided in the assignment.

:::

**Reactor**: BSTR

**Given**: $V = 500\text{ cm}^3$.

**Adjusted Inputs**: $\underline{T}$, $\underline{P}_{A,0}$, $\underline{P}_{B,0}$, and $\underline{t}_{rxn}$

**Experimental Response**: $\underline{f}_{A,\text{ expt}}$

**Rate Expression Parameter**: $k$

The experiments were performed at one of three temperature levels, so three same-temperature blocks of data can be created from the full data set.

The assignment asks me to perform the data analysis twice. The information above applies for both analyses. I'll do the analysis using a response function first. To create a response function I need to first write the design equations for the reactor. Since the experimental reactor was isothermal, only the mole balance design equations are needed to model the reactor.

:::

#### Analysis using a Response Function

**Reactor Model**

Mole balance design equations for reagents A, B, Y, and Z are presented in equations (3) through (6). The initial values and stopping criterion needed to solve them are listed in @tbl-example_9_2_initial_values.

$$
\frac{dn_A}{dt} = -Vr \tag{3}
$$

$$
\frac{dn_B}{dt} = -Vr \tag{4}
$$

$$
\frac{dn_Y}{dt} = Vr \tag{5}
$$

$$
\frac{dn_Z}{dt} = Vr \tag{6}
$$

| Variable | Initial Value | Stopping Criterion |
|:-------|:-------:|:-------:|
| $t$ | $0$ | $t_{rxn}$ |
| $n_A$ | $n_{A,0}$ |  |
| $n_B$ | $n_{B,0}$ |  |
| $n_Y$ | $0$ | |
| $n_Z$ | $0$ | |

## Click Here to See Where That Came From

When a single reaction occurs in an ideal BSTR, the mole balance design equation is given by @eq-bstr_mole_bal_one_reaction.

$$
\frac{dn_i}{dt} = \nu_i r V
$$

Writing that equation once for each reagent and substituting the stoichiometric coefficients of A (-1), B (-1), Y (1), and Z (1) yields equations (3) through (6).

The instant the reaction starts can be defined as $t=0$. The moles of reagents A and B at that instant can be represented by $n_{A,0}$ and $n_{B,0}$. The assignment states that the reactor was charged with only reagents A and B, so reagents Y and Z were not present, i. e. their molar amounts at $t=0$ is zero. The response was measured at $t_{rxn}$, so the stopping criterion is $t=t_{rxn}$. 

:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Click Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point

The design equations are IVODEs. The independent variable is $t$ and the dependent variables are $n_A$, $n_B$, $n_Y$, and $n_Z$. In order to solve those IVODEs numerically I need to go through the design equations, initial values and stopping criterion and express every quantity that is in them, or that gets subtituted into them, in terms of known constants, the independent variable and the dependent variables.

The design equations will be solved within a response function so that the adjusted inputs, $\underline{T}$, $\underline{P}_{A,0}$, $\underline{P}_{B,0}$, and $\underline{t}_{rxn}$, and the rate expression parameter, $k$, will be available. When the rate expression, equation (2) is substituted into the design equations it will introduce the partial pressures of A and B. The ideal gas law can be used to calculate them.

The initial molar amounts of A and B are not provided in the assignment, either. They also can be calculated using the ideal gas law since the assignment does provide their initial partial pressures.

Thus, I need ancillary equations to calculate the $P_A$, $P_B$, $n_{A,0}$, and $n_{B,0}$ using known constants, $t$, $n_A$, $n_B$, $n_Y$, and $n_Z$.

:::

**Ancillary Equations**

$$
P_A = \frac{n_ART}{V} \tag{7}
$$

$$
P_B = \frac{n_BRT}{V} \tag{8}
$$

$$
n_{A,0} = \frac{P_{A,0}V}{RT} \tag{9}
$$

$$
n_{B,0} = \frac{P_{B,0}V}{RT} \tag{10}
$$

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Click Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point

The design equations will be solved within a response function to obtain the values of $n_A$, $n_B$, $n_Y$, and $n_Z$ at $t=t_{rxn}$. That result must then be used to calculate the predicted value of the experimental response, $f_A$. The defining equation for the fractional conversion will serve this purpose.

:::

**Response Calculation**

$$
f_A = \frac{n_{A,0} - n_A}{n_{A,0}} \tag{11}
$$

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Click Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point

Now I can create the response function. It will receive the adjusted inputs and the rate expression parameter as arguments. With those values, the design equations can be solved numerically as described above. The resulting value of $n_A$ at $t_{rxn}$ can be used to calculate the conversion of A and return its value.

:::

**Response Function**

The response function is created with the following structure:

* The adjusted inputs, $\underline{T}$, $\underline{P}_{A,0}$, $\underline{P}_{B,0}$, and $\underline{t}_{rxn}$, and the rate expression parameter, $k$, are passed to it as arguments.
* Variables are defined and assigned the values of all known and given quantities.
* A function that evaluates the design equations given values of the independent variable, $t$, and the dependent variables, $n_A$, $n_B$, $n_Y$, and $n_Z$ is defined. It
    * Calculates $P_A$ and $P_B$ using equations (7) and (8).
    * Calculates $r$ using equation (2).
    * Evaluates the derivatives, equations (3) through (6).
* For each experiment the response function
    * Calculates $n_{A,0}$ and $n_{B,0}$ using equations (9) and (10).
    * Solves the design equations using the initial values and stopping criterion in @tbl-example_9_2_initial_values to find $n_A$, $n_B$, $n_Y$, and $n_Z$ at $t_{rxn}$.
    * Calculates $f_A$ at $t_{rxn}$ using equation (11).
* The values of $f_A$ for all of the experiments are returned.

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Click Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point

Having created the response function, I can now use it to estimate the rate expression parameter, $k$, at each of the experimental temperature levels. To do so I will use parameter estimation software of my choosing. I will write a simple program that passes the adjusted inputs, the measured responses, and a guess for the rate expression parameter to that parameter estimation software. I will exectute this program using each of the same-temperature data blocks, and it will return the best estimate for $k$, some measure of the uncertainty in $k$, and the coefficient of determination, $R^2$, for each experimental temperature level.

Using the resulting value of $k$ for each data block, I then can calculate the model-predicted response and the residual (difference between the measured response and the model-predicted response) for each eperiment. Additionally, as described in @sec-4_kin_data_gen, a parity plot and residuals plots can be created.

To complete the analysis, I will fit the Arrhenius expression to the resulting $k$ *vs*. $T$ data. (see [Example -@sec-example_4_4])

:::

**Calculations**

1. For each temperature level used in the experiments:
    a. Pass the response function, the adjusted inputs for that temperature, and the experimental responses for that temperature to parameter estimation software to find $k$, the uncertainty in $k$, and the coefficient of determination, $R^2$, for that temperature.
    b. Use the resulting value of $k$ to create a parity plot ($C_{A,\text{ expt}}$ *vs*. $C_{A,\text{ model}}$) and residuals plots ($C_{A,\text{ expt}}$ - $C_{A,\text{ model}}$ *vs*. $C_{A,0}$ and *vs*. $t_{rxn}$) for that temperature.
2. Fit the Arrhenius expression to the $k$ *vs*. $T$ data from step 1a. (see @sec-example_4_4)

**Assessment**

## Click Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point

I now need to assess the accuracy of the model and make a decision whether to accept it, recommend additional experiments, or reject it. Here, all of the accuracy criteria are satisfied.

* The coefficient of determination is close to 1.0 for each of the three temperature levels and for the Arrhenius plot.
* The upper and lower limits of the 95% confidence interval are close to the parameter value for all three estimates of $k$ and for the estimate of $E$. The confidence interval for $k_0$ is very large, but this is often seen for the pre-exponential factor.
* The data points in the parity plots all lie close to the diagonal line and those in the Arrhenius plot fall almost exactly on the line representing the Arrhenius expression.
* The data points in the residuals plots scatter randomly about zero and the data points in the Arrhenius plot scatter randomly from the line. In all cases no apparent trend can be seen in the deviations.

These results indicate that the model is accurate and should be accepted.

:::

The rate expression in equation (2) is accurate when the Arrhenius expression is used to represent the temperature dependence of $k$. Equation (2) should be accepted as the rate expression with `r d$value[1]` `r d$units[1]` as the pre-exponential factor and `r d$value[4]` `r d$units[4]` as the activation energy.

#### Analysis using a Linearized Reactor Model

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Click Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point

The assignment instructs me to repeat the analysis using a linearized reactor model. That means I must use a *single* mole balance on one of the products or reactants to model the reactor. (Because the reactor is isothermal, I can solve the mole balance independently of the energy balances.) The response in this problem is the fractional conversion of reagent A, so I'll write the mole balance on reagent A.

The mole balance will be a differential equation. I know that I will need to solve that IVODE *analytically* before I'll be able to linearize the model.

:::

**Linearized Reactor Model**

A mole balance on reagent A is shown in equation (12), where the rate expression, equation (2) has been substituted into the mole balance.

$$
\frac{dn_A}{dt} = -kVP_AP_B \tag{12}
$$

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Click Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point

I need to solve equation (12) *analytically* before I can linearize it. To do that, I need to express every variable quantity appearing in it in terms of the dependent variable, $n_A$, and the independent variable $t$. In any one experiment, $k$ and $V$ will be constant, but $P_A$ and $P_B$ will change as the reaction proceeds. Consequently, I need to express $P_A$ and $P_B$ in terms of $n_A$ and $t$.

:::

Using the ideal gas law, the partial pressures can be eliminated, equation (13).

$$
\frac{dn_A}{dt} = -kV\left( \frac{n_ART}{V} \right)\left( \frac{n_BRT}{V} \right) = \frac{-k\left(RT\right)^2}{V}n_An_B \tag{13}
$$

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Click Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point

Expressing $P_B$ using the ideal gas law introduced the molar amount of B, $n_B$. Next it must be expressed in terms of $n_A$ and $t$. This can be accomplished using the apparent extent of reaction (see @sec-1_reaction_progress).

Start by expressing the molar amount of reagent B in terms of its initial amount and the apparent extent of the reaction.

$$
n_B = n_{B,0} - \xi
$$

Then express $\xi$ in terms of the molar amount of reagent A.

$$
n_A = n_{A,0} - \xi \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \xi = n_{A,0} - n_A
$$

Substuting the second expression into the first gives an expression for the molar amount of reagent B.

$$
n_B = n_{B,0} - n_{A,0} + n_A
$$

:::

After expressing the molar amount of B in terms of the molar amount of A, equation (14) results.

$$
\frac{dn_A}{dt} = \frac{-k\left(RT\right)^2}{V}n_A\left( n_{B,0} - n_{A,0} + n_A \right) \tag{14}
$$

Separation of variables and integration then leads to equation (15).

$$
\frac{1}{n_{A,0}-n_{B,0}} \ln{\frac{n_{A,0}\left( n_{B,0} - n_{A,0} + n_A  \right)}{n_{B,0}n_A}} = \frac{-k\left(RT\right)^2}{V} t\tag{15}
$$

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Click Here to See Where That Came From

Rearrange equation (15) so only $n_A$ appears on the left side and only $t$ appears on the right.

$$
\frac{dn_A}{n_A\left( n_{B,0} - n_{A,0} + n_A \right)} = \frac{-k\left(RT\right)^2}{V}dt
$$

Then integrate noting that at $t=0$, $n_A = n_{A,0}$, at any later time, $t$, the molar amount of reagent A is $n_A$, and $k$, $R$, $T$, and $V$ are constants that can be taken outside of the integral.

$$
\int_{n_{A,0}}^{n_A}\frac{dn_A}{n_A\left( n_{B,0} - n_{A,0} + n_A \right)} = \frac{-k\left(RT\right)^2}{V}\int_{t_0}^tdt
$$

$$
\frac{1}{n_{B,0}-n_{A,0}} \left(\ln{\frac{ n_{B,0} - n_{A,0} + n_A  }{n_A}}\right)\Bigg\vert_{n_{A,0}}^{n_A} = \frac{-k\left(RT\right)^2}{V} t\Big\vert_{t_0}^t
$$

Evaluating at the upper and lower limits and taking the difference on each side then yields equation (15).

:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Click Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point

Looking at equation (15), I can see that the first fraction will become infinite if $n_{A,0} = n_{B,0}$, and some of the experiments have equal initial partial pressures of reagents A and B. If $n_{A,0} = n_{B,0}$ then $n_A$ will equal $n_B$ at all times because one A is consumed every time one B is consumed in the reaction. In this case, the rate expression becomes $r=kP_A^2$, so the reactor model is as follows.

$$
\frac{dn_A}{dt} = -kVP_A^2
$$

Rearrange so only $n_A$ appears on the left side and only $t$ appears on the right.

$$
\frac{dn_A}{n_A^2} = \frac{-k\left(RT\right)^2}{V}dt
$$

Then integrate noting that at $t=0$, $n_A = n_{A,0}$, at any later time, $t$, the molar amount of reagent A is $n_A$, and $k$, $R$, $T$, and $V$ are constants that can be taken outside of the integral.

$$
\int_{n_{A,0}}^{n_A}\frac{dn_A}{n_A^2} = \frac{-k\left(RT\right)^2}{V}\int_{t_0}^tdt
$$

$$
\frac{-1}{n_A}\Bigg\vert_{n_{A,0}}^{n_A} = \frac{-k\left(RT\right)^2}{V} t\Big\vert_{t_0}^t
$$

Evaluating at the upper and lower limits and taking the difference on each side then yields equation (16), below.

:::

If $n_{A,0} = n_{B,0}$, separation of variables and integration leads to equation (16).

$$
\frac{1}{n_{A,0}} - \frac{1}{n_A} = \frac{-k\left(RT\right)^2}{V} t\tag{16}
$$

:::{.callout-note collapse="false"}
## Note

Someone just starting to learn about kinetic data analysis might not have noticed that the initial fraction in equation (15) will become infinite if $n_{A,0} = n_{B,0}$. In that case, the analysis would have failed a little later, indicating that something was wrong. Eventually the new learner might figure out the problem, but this is one of those times when a little prior experience (or the ability to ask a teacher who has such experience) really helps. 

:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Click Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point

Having solved the mole balance ODE, the next step is to linearize it. In this problem nothing needs to be done. It is already linear. That means that I next need to calculate the values of $x$ and $y$ for each experimental data point.

:::

If $y$ is defined as shown in equation (17) for experiments where $n_{A,0} = n_{B,0}$, or as shown in equation (18) when $n_{A,0} \ne n_{B,0}$, and $x$ is defined as shown in equation (19), it can be seen that the model for both cases is a linear equation with a slope equal to $k$, equation (20).

$$
y = \frac{1}{n_{A,0}} - \frac{1}{n_A} \tag{17}
$$

$$
y = \frac{1}{n_{B,0}-n_{A,0}} \ln{\frac{n_{A,0}\left( n_{B,0} - n_{A,0} + n_A  \right)}{n_{B,0}n_A}} \tag{18}
$$

$$
x = \frac{-t\left(RT\right)^2}{V} \tag{19}
$$

$$
y=kx \tag{20}
$$

**Ancillary Equations**

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Click Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point

Now that I have a linearized model, I need to calculate $x$ and $y$ for every experiment and then fit equation (20) to the resulting data. Looking at equations (17) through (19) I see that to calculate $y$ I will need the initial molar amounts of reagents A and B and the final amount of reagent A. The initial molar amounts can be calculated using equations (9) and (10), but I need an equation for $n_A$. The initial amount of A and its conversion are known, and can be used to calculate $n_A$.

:::

$$
n_A = n_{A,0} \left( 1 - f_A \right) \tag{21}
$$

**Calculations**

1. For each temperature level used in the experiments:
    a. Calculate $n_{A,0}$, $n_{B,0}$, and $n_A$ using equations (9), (10), and (21).
    b. Calculate the values of $x$ and $y$ for each experiment using equations (17) or (18) and equation (19).
    c. Using a spreadsheet or linear least squares software, fit equation (20) to the resulting data.
    d. Use the resulting value of $k$ to create a model plot ($y$ *vs*. $x$ as points and the model, $y=kx$, as a line) for that temperature.
2. Fit the Arrhenius expression to the $k$ *vs*. $T$ data from step 1c. (see [Example -@sec-example_4_4])

I now need to assess the accuracy of the model and make a decision whether to accept it, recommend additional experiments, or reject it. As was the case when using the response function, all of the accuracy criteria are satisfied, and the rate expression should be accepted.

* The coefficient of determination is close to 1.0 for each of the three temperature levels and for the Arrhenius plot.
* The upper and lower limits of the 95% confidence interval are close to the parameter value for all three estimates of $k$ and for the estimate of $E$. The confidence interval for $k_0$ is larger, but again, this is often seen for the pre-exponential factor.
* The data points in the model plots and the Arrhenius plot all lie close to the line representing the model.
* The data points in the model and Arrhenius plots scatter randomly from the line representing the model, and there is no apparent trend in the deviations.

:::

The rate expression in equation (2) is accurate when the Arrhenius expression is used to represent the temperature dependence of $k$. Equation (2) should be accepted as the rate expression with `r dd$value[1]` `r dd$units[1]` as the pre-exponential factor and `r dd$value[4]` `r dd$units[4]` as the activation energy.

#### Comparision of the Two Analyses

The two analyses produce virtually identical results. This is expected because the same data set and rate expression were used, and neither of the reactor models introduces any approximations. Recall, when a differential analysis was used in[Example -@sec-example_9_1], there was greater uncertainty in the parameters obtained by differential analysis because differential data analysis uses an appeoximate mole balance equation.

Analysis using a linearized model, as in this example, is just as accurate as analysis using a response function. The only issues associated with using a linearized model are that for some rate expressions it may not be possible to solve the mole balance design equation analytically, and when it can be solved analytically, it may not be possible to linearize it. Analysis using a response function can always be used.
