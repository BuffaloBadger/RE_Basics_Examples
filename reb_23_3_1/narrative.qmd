Suppose the non-ideal reactor from Example [-@sec-example_22_5_1] is going to be used to convert an aqueous solution of A to Z as indicated in equation (1). The feed rate to the 10 L reactor is 3 L min^-1^, and the cumulative age distribution found in that example applies. The feed temperature is 300 K and it contains only reagent A at a concentration of 0.5 M. According to the early-mixing segregated flow reactor model, what conversion of A and outlet temperature can be expected if the reactor operates adiabatically at a pressure of 1 atm?

The rate expression is given in equation (2) where the pre-exponential factor is equal to 5.29 x 10^9^ L mol^-1^ min^-1^ and the activation energy is 12,100 cal mol^-1^. The heat of reaction (1) is -24,400 cal mol^-1^, the heat capacity may be taken to be constant at 1.0 cal ml^-1^ K^-1^, and the density is constant at 1.0 g ml^-1^.
