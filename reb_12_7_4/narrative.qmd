An adiabatic, steady-state CSTR with a volume of 500 cm^3^ is going to be used to convert A and B into Y and Z. A liquid- solution flowing at 1.0 cm^3^ s^-1^ and containing equal amounts of A and B (0.015 mol cm^-3^) at 50 Â°C will be used. The heat capacity of the fluid is essentially equal to that of the solvent, 0.35 cal g^-1^ K^-1^ and can be considered to be constant. The (constant) density of the fluid is 0.93 gm cm^-3^. The rate expression for reaction (1) is given in equation (2), and the heat of reaction (1) may be assumed to be constant and equal to -20 kJ mol^-1^. The pre-exponential factor is 3.24 x 10^12^ cm^3^ mol^-1^ s^-1^, and the activation energy is 105.0 kJ mol^-1^. At these conditions three different steady states are possible; determine the conversion and outlet temperature for each of them.
