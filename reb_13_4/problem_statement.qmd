The rate expression for liquid-phase reaction (1) is given in equation (2). The rate coefficient displays Arrhenius temperature dependence with a pre-exponential factor of 2.59 x 10^9^ min^-1^ and an activation energy of 16.5 kcal mol^-1^. The heat of reaction (1) may be taken to be constant and equal to -22,200 cal mol^-1^. A solution containing only A at a concentration of 2M and a temperature of 23 °C is going to be processed in a BSTR. The heat capacity of the solution is approximately constant and equal to 440 cal L^-1^ K^-1^, and its density is constant.

A \rightarrow Z \tag{1}

$$
r_1 = k_1C_A \tag{2}

The 4.0 L BSTR has a perfectly mixed jacket with a volume of 0.5 L, a heat transfer area of 0.6 ft^2^, and a heat transfer coefficient of 1.13 x 10^4^ cal ft^-2^ h^-1^ K^-1^. Cooling water at 20 °C can be fed to the jacket. The water may be taken to have a constant density of 1 g cm^-3^ and a constant heat capacity of 1 cal g^-1^ K^-1^. A heating coil with a heat transfer coefficient of 3.8 x 10^4^ cal ft^-2^ h^-1^ K^-1^ and a heat transfer area of 0.23 ft^2^ can be submerged in and extracted from the reacting solution. Saturated steam at 120 °C can admitted to the coil.

The BSTR is charged with 4 L of a 2 M solution of A at 23 °C. Initially there is no flow to the jacket, but it is filled with water, also at 23 °C. To start the batch process, the steam is admitted to the coil, and the coil is immersed in the solution. When the reacting fluid reaches 50 °C, the coil is extraced from the reacting fluid and cooling water flow to the jacket is started. When the reacting fluid reaches a temperature of 25 °C the cooling water flow is stopped, the reactor is drained and preparations for processing the next batch begin. The BSTR pressure is constant throughout all stages of processing. If the turnaround time for the reactor is 25 min, what coolant flow rate will maximize the net rate of production of Z?
