Using the criteria presented in @sec-5_response_opt_design, this is an isolated reactor modeling assignment. The system consists of a BSTR and no other equipment. The reactor and its operation are described. The reaction taking place is indentified and its rate expression is provided, and it asks for a reactor input, namely the coolant flow rate. This is an optimization assignment because the coolant flow rate of interest is the one that maximizes the net rate of production of Z.

Having identified this as an isolated reactor optimization assignment, I know from @sec-5_response_opt_design that completing the assignment entails five basic steps.

1. Summarize the information provided in the assignment.
2. Formulate the solution mathematically.
3. Implement the solution numerically.
4. Execute the solution.
5. Report and comment upon the results.

To complete the first step, I'll read through the assignment and list the following things. Since this reactor has both a jacket and a coil, I'll use a subscripted "ex" to denote quantities related to the jacket and "coil" to denote quantities related to the coil. The operating protocol for this reactor has two stages, a heating stage and a cooling stage. I'll use a subscripted "0" to denote values of quantities at the start of the heating stage, a subscripted "1" to denote quantities at end of the heating stage (which is also the start of the cooling stage), and a subscripted "f" to denote quantities at the end of the cooling stage (which is also the end of the process).

1. Summarize the information provided in the assignment.
	a. Reactor type and operational mode
	b. Constant quantities
	c. Adjusted quantities
	d. Missing reactor input or process parameter and specified reactor response
	e. Quantities of interest

Upon reading the assignment narrative, I see that one of the quantities of interest is the coolant flow rate during the second stage that maximizes the net rate of reaction. To find the optimum coolant flow rate, $\dot{m}_{ex,opt}$, the net rate will be calculated using a range of coolant flow rates, and the one that maximizes the net rate will be identified. For this reason, I'll list the coolant flow rate as an adjusted quantity.

:::

**Adjusted Quantity**: $\dot{m}_{ex}$

**Quantities of Interest**: $\dot{m}_{ex,opt}$, $r_{Z,net,max}$, $f_A\left(t\right)\Big\vert_{\dot{m}_{ex,opt}}$, $T\left(t\right)\Big\vert_{\dot{m}_{ex,opt}}$

The second basic step for completing an isolated BSTR modeling assignment is to formulate the solution mathematically. From my reading of this chapter, I know, generally, how to do this.

2. Formulate the solution mathematically.
	a. Choose, write and simplify the reactor design equations needed to model the reactor.
	b. Identify the independent variable and the dependent variables, and ensure that the number of dependent variables is equal to the number of reactor design equations.
	c. Specify the initial values and the stopping criterion, and write equations for calculating their values.
	d. Write equations to express every quantity appearing in the reactor design equations or in equations that will be substituted into the reactor design equations in terms of known constants, the independent variable, the dependent variables, the missing reactor input or process parameter (if there is one), and the adjusted quantities (if there are any).
	e. Write the equations to calculate every quantity of interest and the response that was specified in the assignment (if there is one) using the results from solving the reactor design equations, the independent variable, the dependent variables, the missing reactor input or process parameter (if there is one), and the adjusted quantities (if there are any).
	f. Briefly explain or outline the sequence of calculations that must be used to calculate and process the quantities of interest (and the response that was specified in the assignment, if there is one).

**Mathematical Formulation of the Solution**

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}

The operational protocol for this reactor has two stages. I need to write and simplify the reactor design equations needed to model each stage of the operation of this system. The reactor is the same in the heating and cooling stages, so the same reactor design equation apply to both stages, but some of the terms in the equations change between the first and second stage of operation.

The reactor design equations always include at least one mole balance. The general BSTR mole balance is given in @eq-bstr_mole_balance.  I'll write a mole balance for both of the reagents in this system, noting that the sum reduces to a single term since only one reaction is taking place.

$$
\frac{dn_i}{dt} = V \cancelto{\nu_{i,1}r_1}{\sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j}
$$

The BSTR is not isothermal, so I must include an energy balance on the reacting fluid among the design equations. The general BSTR mole balance is given in @eq-bstr_energy_balance. Assuming the liquid to be incompressible and the reactor walls to be rigid, both the pressure and volume will be constant, so their time-derivatives will equal zero. The work associated with mixing the reactor can also be assumed to be negligible. There is only one reaction occurring, so the final sum will reduce to a single term. In addition, the assignment provides the volumetric heat capacity of the entire solution, so the sensible heat term can be written in terms of that heat capacity, @eq-bstr_equivalent_sens_heat_terms. During the first stage of the operating protocol, heat is exchanged with both the cooling water and the steam, so the rate of heat exchange must be split into two terms. During the second stage the coil is not present.

$$
\cancelto{V \breve{C}_p}{\left(\sum_i n_i \hat C_{p,i} \right)} \frac{dT}{dt} - V\cancelto{0}{\frac{dP}{dt}}  - P  \cancelto{0}{\frac{dV}{dt}}  = \cancelto{\dot{Q}_{ex} + \dot{Q}_{coil}}{\dot Q} - \cancelto{0}{\dot W} - V \cancelto{r_1 \Delta H_1}{\sum_j \left(r_j \Delta H_j \right)}
$$

$$
V \breve{C}_p \frac{dT}{dt} = \dot{Q}_{ex} + \dot{Q}_{coil} - V r_1 \Delta H_1
$$

There are two heat exchange fluids in this system. The water in the jacket exchanges sensible heat so the energy balance on it is given by @eq-exchange_energy_bal_sensible. During the first stage of the operating protocol, the coolant is not flowing, so $\dot{m}_{ex} = 0$. Noting that the heat capacity is constant, the integral is easily evaluated.

$$
\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \tilde C_{p,ex}\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt} = -\dot{Q}_{ex} - \dot m_{ex} \int_{T_{ex,in}}^{T_{ex}} \tilde C_{p,ex}dT
$$

The steam in the coil exchanges latent heat, so its temperature is known and constant. As a consequence, the mole balances, energy balance on the reacting fluid and energy balance on the cooling water can be solved independently of the energy balance on the steam. The problem does not ask any questions about the steam flow rate or how much of it condenses, so an energy balance on the steam is not needed.

Momentum balances are not used for stirred tank reactors, so the full set of reactor design equations consists of mole balances on A and Z, an energy balance on the reacting fluid and an energy balance on the cooling water.

:::

**Reactor Design Equations**

Mole balances on A and Z, equations (3) and (4) are the same in heating stage of the protocol and in the cooling stage. An energy balance on the reacting fluid and an energy balance on the coolant in the shell during the heating stage are shown in equations (5) and (6). During the cooling stage of the operating protocol, an energy balance on the reacting fluid and an energy balance on the coolant take the forms shown in equations (7) and (8).

$$
\frac{dn_A}{dt} = -Vr_1 \tag{3}
$$

$$
\frac{dn_Z}{dt} = Vr_1 \tag{4}
$$

$$
\frac{dT}{dt} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{ex} + \dot{Q}_{coil}  - Vr_1 \Delta H_1}{V \breve C_p} \tag{5}
$$

$$
\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt} = -\left(\frac{\dot{Q}_{ex}}{\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \tilde C_{p,ex}}\right) \tag{6}
$$

$$
\frac{dT}{dt} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{ex}  - Vr_1 \Delta H_1}{V \breve C_p} \tag{7}
$$

$$
\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt} = -\left(\frac{\dot{Q}_{ex} + \dot m_{ex} \tilde{C}_{p,ex} \left(T_{ex} - T_{ex,in}\right)}{\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \tilde C_{p,ex}}\right) \tag{8}
$$

In both stages of operation, the four reactor design equations are IVODEs, and they contain four dependent variables ($n_A$, $n_B$, $T$, and $T_{ex}$), so no additional IVODEs are needed. Initial values and a stopping criterion are needed to solve the design equations.

The instant the solution is added to the reactor can be defined as $t=0$. This marks the start of the heating phase. The molar amounts of A, $n_{A,0}$, and Z, 0.0 (only A is present initially), the reacting fluid temperature, $T_0$, and the cooling water temperature, $T_{ex,0}$, at that time are then the initial values for the analysis of the heating phase. It ends when the reacting fluid reaches $T_1 = 50 °C$.  The initial molar amount of A is not given, but it can be calculated from the initial concentration.

The cooling phase begins the instant the heating phase ends, so the initial values for the cooling phase are the final values from the heating phase. The cooling phase ends when the reacting fluid cools down to $T_f = 25 °C$, so that is the stopping criterion for the cooling phase.

:::

The initial values and stopping criterion for solving the reactor design equations for the heating phase are presented in @tbl-example_13_4_heating_initial_values. The initial molar amount of A can be calculated using equation (9). If $t_1$, $n_{A,1}$, $n_{Z,1}$, and $T_{ex,1}$ represent the values of $t$, $n_A$, $n_Z$, and $T_{ex}$ at the end of the heating phase, those values are also the intial values for the cooling phase, which ends when $T = T_f$. Thus, the initial values and stopping criterion for the coolling phase are given in @tbl-example_13_4_cooling_initial_values

| Variable | Initial Value | Stopping Criterion |

The design equations cannot be solved until every quantity appearing in them and every quantity substituted into them is expressed in terms of known constants, the independent variable, $t$, and the dependent variables, $n_A$, $n_Z$, $T$, and $T_{ex}$. As noted earlier, the design equations will be solved using a range of values of $\dot{m}_{ex}$, so $\dot{m}_{ex}$ will be a known constant when the reactor design equations are solved.

Looking at the reactor design equations, I see that $V$, $\breve{C}_p$, $\Delta H_1$, $\rho_{ex}$, $\tilde{C}_{p,ex}$, $\dot{m}_{ex}$, and $T_ex,in$ are known constants. The remaining quantities in the reactor design equations, $r_1$, $\dot{Q}=_{ex}$, and $\dot{Q}_{coil}$ must be expressed in terms of known constants, the independent variable, and the dependent variables.

The reaction rate, $r_1$, is given by equation (2); it introduces $k_1$ and $C_A$ when it is substituted into the design equations. The rate coefficient can be expressed in terms of known constants ($k_{0,1}$, $E_1$, and the gas constant, $R$) using the Arrhenius expression, @eq-arrhenius. The concentration of A can be expressed in terms of the molar amount of A and the volume using the definition of concentration.

The rate of heat exchange between the water in the jacket and the reacting fluid can be expressed in terms of the known constants, $A_{ex}$ and $U_{ex}$, and the jacket and reacting fluid temperatures. Similarly, the rate of heat exchange between the steam in the coil and the reacting fluid can be expressed in terms of the known constants, $U_{coil}$, $A_{coil}$, and $T_{coil}$ = 120 °C, and the reacting fluid temperature.

:::

**Ancillary Equations for Solving the Reactor Design Equations**

The rate is given by equation (2), where the rate coefficient is found using equation (8) and the concentration of A is found using equation (9).

$$
k_1 = k_{0,1}\exp{\left( \frac{-E_1}{RT} \right)} \tag{10}
$$

$$
C_A = \frac{n_A}{V} \tag{11}
$$

The rate of heat exchange with the steam in the coil is given by equation (10), and the rate of heat exchange between the water in the jacket and the reacting fluid is given by equation (11).

$$
\dot{Q}_{coil} = U_{coil} A_{coil} \left(T_{coil} - T\right) \tag{12}
$$

$$
\dot{Q}_{ex} = U_{ex} A_{ex} \left(T_{ex} - T\right) \tag{13}
$$

At this point, the design equations can be solved to find $n_A\left(t\right)$, $n_Z\left(t\right)$, $T\left(t\right)$, and $T_{ex}\left(t\right)$ at times between $t=0$ and the time, $t_f$ (the time when the reactor has cooled to 25 °C). The net rate of production of Z can then be calculated using , and the conversion as a function of processing time can be calculated using its definition, @eq-conversion_def_closed. If the calculations are repeated using a range of values of $\dot{m}_{ex}$ that is sufficiently wide that $r_{Z,net}$ passes through a maximum, the maximum net rate and the optimum coolant flow rate can be identified.

**Ancillary Equations for Calculating the Quantities of Interest**

$$
r_{Z,net} = \frac{n_Z\big\vert_{t_f}}{t_f + t_{turn}} \tag{14}

$$

$$
r_{Z,net,max} = \underset{\dot{m}_{ex}}{\max}\left( r_{Z,net} \right) \tag{17}
$$

7. Solve equations (3), (4), (7), and (8) using the initial values and stopping criterion in @tbl-example_13_4_cooling_initial_values to get $n_A\left(t\right)$, $n_Z\left(t\right)$, $T\left(t\right)$ and $T_{ex}\left(t\right)$ during the cooling stage.
8. Calculate $r_{Z,net}$ using equation (15).
9. Repeat steps 1 through 8 many times using a range of values of $\dot{m}_{ex}$ that is broad enough for $r_{Z,net}$ to pass through a maximum.
10. Identify the optimum coolant flow rate and the maximum net rate using equations (16) and (17).
11. Repeat steps 1 through 7 using the optimum coolant flow rate in step 1.
12. Use the results from step 7 to calculate the conversion as a function of time at the optimum coolant flow rate, equation (15).
13. Plot $f_A\left(t\right)\Big\vert_{\dot{m}_{ex,opt}}$ *vs*. $t$ and $T\left(t\right)\Big\vert_{\dot{m}_{ex,opt}}$ *vs*. $t$.

Having formulated the solution mathematically, the third basic step for completing an isolated reactor modeling assignment is to implement the solution numerically. I know that this will entail creating two computer functions.

3. Implement the solution numerically.
	a. Create a response function.
		i. Pass the missing value (if there is one) and the adjusted values (if there are any) to it as arguments.
		ii. Solve the reactor design equations for each set of adjusted values.
		iii. Calculate and return the quantities of interest (and the specified response if there is one) corresponding to each set of adjusted values.
	b. Create a calculations function.

I know that the purpose of the response function is to calculate the quantities of interest. In this assignment there isn't a missing reactor input or process parameter. That means that the response function will not have a missing value argument.

There is an adjusted value, namely $\dot{m}_{ex}$, so the response function will be passed a vector containing a range of values of $\dot{m}_{ex}. The response function must loop through those values. For each one it needs to complete steps 2 through 12 in the sequence given above. It should then return the quantities of interest: $\dot{m}_{ex,opt}$, $r_{Z,net,max}$, $f_A\left(t\right)\Big\vert_{\dot{m}_{ex,opt}}$, $T\left(t\right)\Big\vert_{\dot{m}_{ex,opt}}$.

:::

**Response Function**

The response function is created with the following structure:

* It is passed vector containing a range of coolant flow rates, $\dot{m}_{ex}$, as an argument.
* It defines variables and assigns values to them for all known and given constants.
* It loops over the values of the coolant flow rate. For each coolant flow rate
	* It sets the initial values and stopping criterion according to @tbl-example_13_4_heating_initial_values and equation (9).
	* In preparation for solving equations (3) through (6), it defines a function to evaluate $\frac{dn_A}{dt}$, $\frac{dn_Z}{dt}$, $\frac{dT}{dt}$, and $\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt}$ using equations (3) through (6). That function
		* receives values for $t$, $n_A$, $n_Z$, $T$, and $T_{ex}$,
		* calculates $k$ and $C_A$ using equations (10) and (11),
		* calculates $r_1$, $\dot{Q}_{coil}$, and $\dot{Q}_{ex}$ using equations (4), (12), and (13).
		* calculates and returns $\frac{dn_Z}{dt}$, $\frac{dT}{dt}$, and $\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt}$ using equations (3) through (6).
	* The response function next calls an IVODE solver to solve equations (3) through (6) and get vectors containing values for $t$, $n_A$, $n_Z$, $T$, and $T_{ex}$ during the heating stage, passing the function above and the initial values and stopping criterion in @tbl-example_13_4_heating_initial_values as arguments.
	* In preparation for solving equations (3), (4), (7), and (8), it defines a function to evaluate $\frac{dn_A}{dt}$, $\frac{dn_Z}{dt}$, $\frac{dT}{dt}$, and $\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt}$ using those equations. That function
		* receives values for $t$, $n_A$, $n_Z$, $T$, and $T_{ex}$,
		* calculates $k$ and $C_A$ using equations (10) and (11),
		* calculates $r_1$, $\dot{Q}_{coil}$, and $\dot{Q}_{ex}$ using equations (4), (12), and (13).
		* calculates and returns $\frac{dn_Z}{dt}$, $\frac{dT}{dt}$, and $\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt}$ using equations (3), (4), (7), and (8).
	* The response function next calls an IVODE solver to solve equations (3), (4), (7), and (8) and get vectors containing values for $t$, $n_A$, $n_Z$, $T$, and $T_{ex}$ during the cooling stage, passing the function above and the initial values and stopping criterion in @tbl-example_13_4_cooling_initial_values as arguments. 
	* It calculates and saves $r_{Z,net}$ using equation (14).
* After looping through all of the coolant flow rates, it identifies the maximum net rate and the corresponding optimum coolant flow rate, equations (16) and (17).
* It solves the IVODEs as above using the optimum coolant flow rate.
* It combines the results for the heating stage and the cooling stage.
* It calculate $f_A\left(t\right)\Big\vert_{\dot{m}_{ex,opt}}$.
* It returns the quantities of interest: $\dot{m}_{ex,opt}$, $r_{Z,net,max}$, $f_A\left(t\right)\Big\vert_{\dot{m}_{ex,opt}}$, $T\left(t\right)\Big\vert_{\dot{m}_{ex,opt}}$.

The calculations function is responsible for performing the entire sequence of calculations listed at the end of the mathematical formulation. After setting a range of values for the coolant flow rate, it can perform steps 2 through 12 by simply calling the response function. Then it can use the results to make the graphs requested in the assighment.

:::

**Calculations Function**

The calculations function is created with the following structure:

* It takes no arguments.
* It sets a range of values of $\dot{m}_{ex}$.
* It calls the response function to get the quantities of interest.
* It checks whether $r_{Z,net}$ passes through a maximum within the range of values of $\dot{m}_{ex}$.
	* If it does not pass through a maximum, reports that a maximum was not found and suggests repeating the calculations using a broader range of values of $\dot{m}_{ex}$.
	* If $r_{Z,net}$ does pass through a maximum, it reports the optimum coolant flow rate and the maximum net rate, plots and displays $f_A\left(t\right)\Big\vert_{\dot{m}_{ex,opt}}$ *vs*. $t$ and $T\left(t\right)\Big\vert_{\dot{m}_{ex,opt}}$ *vs*. $t$, and saves the results to one or more files.

**Performing the Calculations**

After creating the response function and calculations function as described, all of the calculations needed to complete the assignment can be performed by executing the calculations function. (If the calculations function reports that a maximum was not fould, the range of values of $\dot{m}_{ex}$ must be broadened, and the calculations function executed again.)

**Results**

The net rate of production of Z is plotted as a function of the cooling water flow rate in @fig-example_13_4_net_rate_plot. The maximum net rate, `r df$value[1]` `r df$units[1]`, occurs at a coolant flow rate of `r df$value[2]` `r df$units[2]`. The conversion and reacting fluid temperature profiles at that coolant flow rate are shown in @fig-example_13_4_conversion_profile and @fig-example_13_4_temperature_profile.

Knowing the initial concentration of A and the Arrhenius parameters, the conversion and temperature profiles were used to calculate the instantaneous reaction rate profile shown in @fig-example_13_4_rate_profile, where the rate scale is logarithmic.

**Summary and Comments**

The optimum coolant flow rate is `r df$value[2]` `r df$units[2]`. At that coolant flow rate, the net rate of production of Z is `r df$value[1]` `r df$units[1]`. The conversion of A and reacting fluid temperature during processing at the optimum coolant flow rate are shown in Figures [-@fig-example_13_4_conversion_profile] and [-@fig-example_13_4_temperature_profile].

@fig-example_13_4_net_rate_plot shows that the rate effectively zero when the reactant is charged to the BSTR. @fig-example_13_4_temperature_profile shows the steam heating increases the temperature to 50 °C in ca. 2.5 min, at which time the rate has become significant. The temperature continues to rise because heat is being released by reaction faster than it is being removed by the coolant. As the reactant is depleted, the rate does not increase as rapidly until eventually, after ca. 31.1 min, the rate reaches its maximum value. As the rate decreases, the amount of heat released due to reaction decreases until, at ca. 31.5 min, it becomes equal to the rate at which the coolant is removing heat. At that point the temperature passes through a maximum. After that the coolant removes heat faster than it is generated, and after ca. 100 min the temperature reaches 25 °C and processing ends. The conversion at this point is over 99%.

## Note

In this example, the net rate of reaction was maximized with respect to the cooling water flow rate. It might be possible to improve the process further by adjusting both the cooling water flow rate *and* the temperature where the heating coil is removed. If that were done, the graphical approach used here to maximize the net rate would not be the best mathematical approach. Instead, a reaction engineer might use software designed for multivariable optimization.
