[Example -@sec-example_12_7_4] showed that three steady states are possible when reaction (1) takes place in an adiabatic CSTR. Specifically, the reactor volume is 500 cm^3^ and the feed is 1.0 cm^3^ s^-1^ of a solution containing 0.015 mol cm^-3^ each of A and B at 50 °C. The heat capacity is 0.35 cal g^-1^ K^-1^, and the density is 0.93 gm cm^-3^. The heat of reaction is -20 kJ mol^-1^, and the rate is given by equation (2) with the pre-exponential factor equal to 3.24 x 10^12^ cm^3^ mol^-1^ s^-1^ and the activation energy equal to 105.0 kJ mol^-1^. The three steady-state conversions were 0.03%, 39.9%, and 97.5%.

The steady state with 39.9% conversion is expected to be unstable. Show that this is true by calculating the transient response of a reactor operating at that steady state if the reacting fluid temperature is perturbed from the steady-state value of 138 °C to 140 °C holding all of the inputs constant.

The discussion of the results suggested that there is an ignition point at 103 °C. At a feed temperature of 90 °C, the reactor will operate at 4.1% conversion and 99 °C. This is just below the ignition point. To demonstrate that 103 °C is the ignition point, calculate the temperature response if the feed temperature is increased by 1 °C (i. e. from 90 °C to 91 °C).

The discussion of the results of [Example -@sec-example_12_7_4] also suggested that there is an extinction point at 188 °C. At a feed temperature of 4°C, the reactor will operate at 84.5% conversion and 190 °C. This is just above the extinction point. To demonstrate that 188 °C is the extinction point, calculate the temperature response if the feed temperature is decreased by 1 °C (from 4 °C to 3°C).
