[Example -@sec-example_12_7_4] showed conditions where three steady states are possible when reaction (1) takes place in an adiabatic CSTR. Specifically, the reactor volume is 500 cm^3^ and the feed is 1.0 cm^3^ s^-1^ of a solution containing 0.015 mol cm^-3^ each of A and B at 50 °C. The heat capacity is 0.35 cal g^-1^ K^-1^, and the density is 0.93 gm cm^-3^. The heat of reaction is -20 kJ mol^-1^, and the rate is given by equation (2) with the pre-exponential factor equal to 3.24 x 10^12^ cm^3^ mol^-1^ s^-1^ and the activation energy equal to 105.0 kJ mol^-1^. The steady-state conversions were 0.03%, 39.9%, and 97.5%, and the corresponding outlet temperatures were 50, 183, and 265 °C.
