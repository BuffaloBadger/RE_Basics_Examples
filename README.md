Repository for example problems included in "Reaction Engineering Basics."

There is a folder for each Reaction Engineering Basics Example Problem. The folder name is of the form reb_x_y where reb stands for "Reaction Engineering Basics," x is the chapter of "Reaction Engineering Basics" where the problem appears and y is the example number within that chapter. These folders contain the following items (when appropriate).

* a README.md file with any notes regarding the problem.
* the problem statement as a .qmd file.
* a succinct formulation of the solution as a .qmd file.
* python code used to solve the problem.
* Matlab code used to solve the problem.
* numerical results as a .csv file from the Matlab solution and one from the python solution.
* graphical results as .png files.

My intention is that the problem statement and graphical results can be included directly in "Reaction Engineering Basics," "SCoRE," etc. The numerical results can be read in and formatted as desired. The formulation can be copied and pasted and then embellished as desired in the final document.
