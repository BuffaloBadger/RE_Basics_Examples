A 500 L CSTR that has a heat exchange jacket area of 2 m^2^ with an overall heat transfer coefficient of 500 kcal m^-2^ h^-1^ K^-1^ is being used to convert A to Z according to reaction (1). The 150 °C liquid feed to the process is a 2 M solution of A, flowing at 250 L h^-1^. The jacket contains a heat exchange fluid at a constant temperature of 180 °C. The rate expression for reaction (1) is shown in equation (2), where the rate coeffficient displays Arrhenius temerature dependence with a pre-exponential factor of 1.14 x 10^9^ L mol^-1^ h^-1^ and an activation energy of 18.2 kcal mol^-1^. The reacting fluid has a constant density of 1.2 g ml^-1^ and a constant heat capacity of 1.17 cal ml^-1^ K^-1^. The reactor is not an ideal CSTR, but it can be accurately modeled using an axial dispersion model with an axial dispersion coefficient, $D_{ax}$, of 0.3 m^2^ h^-1^ and an axial thermal dispersion coefficent, $\lambda_{ax}$, of 10 cal m^-1^ h^-1^ K^-1^. Compare the conversion and outlet temperature predicted by the axial dispersion model to those predicted by the ideal CSTR model.
