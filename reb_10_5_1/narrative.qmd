A strong acid (15 M) at 20 °C is going to be neutralized using a strong base, B (15 M NaOH), also at 20 °C, equation (1). If the acid and the base were simply mixed together, they would react violenly, releasing enough energy to raise their temperature to over 225 °C. Instead, a 10 L SBSTR will be used to neutralize 5.0 L of the acid. The acid will initially be present in the reactor, and the base will be added a rate of 0.25 L min^-1^ until 5 L of the base have been added. The reacting fluid will exchange heat with 2.5 L cooling water in a perfectly mixed shell. Chilled water at 20 °C will enter the shell at a rate of 2.5 L min^-1^. The heat transfer area is 2150 cm^2^ and the heat transfer coefficient is 73 cal cm^-2^ h^-1^ K^-1^. At the time the acid is charged to the reactor, the cooling water temperature within the heat exchanger is 20 °C. The density and heat capacity of the acid solution, base solution, and cooling water can all be taken to be those of water, 1 g cm^-3^ and  1 cal g^-1^ K^-1^. The neutralization reaction, equation (1), is irreversible with a heat of reaction equal to -13.7 kcal mol^-1^. The reaction is first order in both acid and base with a pre-exponential factor of 8.11 x 10^12^ L mol^-1^ s^-1^ and an activation energy of 17.7 kcal mol^-1^. equation (2). The pressure in the reactor will be constant and equal to 1 atm. Plot the acid concentration and the reactor temperature as functions of time while the base is being added.
