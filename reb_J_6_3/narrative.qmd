This is not an example of a reactor analysis; it simply illustrates how to solve a set of IVODEs that contain an unknown constant. Equations (1) through (3) are representative IVODEs that a reaction engineer might need to solve when analyzing a steady-state, adiabatic PFR with negligible pressure drop. Suppose the engineer is tasked with finding the volumetric flow rate, $\dot{V}$, that results in the outlet $T$ being equal to 325 K, and then using that volumetric flow rate, to calculate $\dot{n}_A\left(z\right)$, $\dot{n}_Z\left(z\right)$, and $T\left(z\right)$. It can be assumed that the reaction engineer knows that the rate expression for $r$ is equation (4), and the following values: $D$ = 5 cm, $\Delta H$ = -14,000 cal mol^-1^, $\breve{C}_p$ = 1.3 cal cm^-3^ K^-1^, $C_{A,in}$ = 0.0025 mol cm^3^, $C_{Z,in}$ = 0, $T_{in}$ = 300 K, $L$ = 50 cm, $k_0$ = 4.2 x 10^15^ cm^3^ mol^-1^ min^-1^, and $E$ = 18,000 cal mol^-1^.
