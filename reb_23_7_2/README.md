This problem involves a gas-phase reaction taking place in an adiabatic, constant-pressure, steady-state reactor. The reactor is modeled using the late-mixing segregated flow reactor.

It is based on example 12.7.2.

The cumulative age distribution function is that of the ideal CSTR in example 12.7.2

F = 1 - exp(-lambda*Vdot/V) with some noise added.
