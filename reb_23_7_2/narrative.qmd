The reaction between A and B, equation (1), is exothermic, $\Delta H$ = -7.2 kcal mol^-1^. The rate expression is given in equation (2) with the Arrhenius pre-exponential factor, $k_0$, equal to 1.37 x 10^5^ m^3 mol^-1 min^-1^ and the activation energy, $E$, to 11.1 kcal mol^-1^. A gas mixture containing 10% A, 65% B and 25% inert, I, flows into a 0.41 m^3^, adiabatic stirred tank reactor at 165 °C and 5 atm. The feed flow rate is 1.0 m^3^ min^-1^, and the heat capacities of A, B, Z, and I are equal to 7.6, 4.2, 13.8, and 4.3 cal mol^-1^ K^-1^, respectively. The ideal CSTR model predicted that 99.1% of the A would be converted and the outlet temperature would be 265 °C. (see Example [-@sec-example_12_7_2].)

When the conversion and outlet temperature from the reactor were different, an engineer suspected that the reactor was non-ideal and measured its cumulative age distribution function. The fir
