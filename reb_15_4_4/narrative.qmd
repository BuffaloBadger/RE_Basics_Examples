A liquid phase process that uses a 60 dm^3^ PFR is going to be shut down so that a second 40 dm^3^
PFR can be added to increase throughput. Space constraints dictate that the second reactor will be
added in parallel with the first. The design calls for processing a feed solution containing 1 mol L^-1^ of A at
60 Â°C and flowing at a rate of 0.55 dm^3^ min^-1^. The solution density may be assumed to be constant. The
reactors will operate adiabatically, at steady state, and with negligible pressure drop. The reaction is irreversible, and the reaction rate is
given in equation (2) where k~0~ = 2.63 x 10^7^ L mol^-1^ min^-1^ and E = 62 kJ mol^-1^. The heat of reaction and the
heat capacity of the solution may be assumed to be constant and equal to -35 kJ mol^-1^ and 800 J L^-1^ K^-1^,
respectively. Compare the conversion when the feed is split equally between the two reactors to the
conversion when the feed is split so that the space times are equal in the two reactors.
