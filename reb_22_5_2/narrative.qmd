A gas-phase reaction is taking place at steady-state in an adiabatic flow reactor. The reaction causes an increase in both the total number of moles and the temperature. As a consequence, the inlet volumetric flow rate is 10 L min^-1^ and the outlet volumetric flow rate is 12.2 L min^-1^. The flowing feed gas contains an inert tracer at a concentration of 2 mmol L^-1^. To measure the cumulative age distribution function, the feed flow of the tracer, but nothing else, was stopped, and the molar concentration of tracer leaving the reactor was measured as a function of time. It should be noted that because the tracer flow rate was very, very small, the total inlet and outlet flow rates were not affected when the tracer flow was stopped.
