A 500 cm^3^ stirred tank reactor is available for the batch production of Z according to reaction (1). The reactor has a cooling jacket with a heat transfer area of 66 cm^2^, a volume of 40 cm^3^ and a heat transfer coefficient of 35 BTU ft^−2^ h^−1^ °F^−1^.  

Reactants A and B are available in separate 3 M solutions at 50 °C. The heat capacity of all solutions containing A, B, Y and/or Z are essentially constant and equal to that of the solvent, 0.35 cal g^−1^ K^−1^. Similarly, the density of all solutions is constant and equal to 0.93 g cm^−3^. Cooling water is available at 40 °C. The cooling water density and heat capacity may be assumed to equal 1 g cm^−3^ and 1 cal g^−1^ K^−1^, respectively.

The rate expression for reaction (1) is given in equation (2) where the pre-exponential factor equals 1.24 x 10^13^ cm^3^ mol^−1^ s^−1^ and the activation energy equals 20 kcal mol^−1^. The heat of reaction (1) may be assumed to be constant and equal to -80 kJ mol^−1^.

Before the process starts, the reactor jacket is full of water at 40 °C. To start the process 250 cm^3^ of each solution is added to the reactor, and cooling water starts to flow into the jacket at a constant flow rate. The process ends when 90% of the A is converted.

$$
A + B \rightarrow Y + Z \tag{1}
$$

$$
r_1 = k_1 C_A C_B \tag{2}
$$

Generate a reactor response function that can be used to calculate the maximum temperature of the reacting fluid as a function of the cooling water flow rate for flow rates between 25 and 100 cm^3^ min^-1^.
