The amount of A, (10%), in a gas mixture with B (65%), and inert, I, (25%) at 165 Â°C and 5 atm needs to be reduced to below 0.1%. This is going to be accomplished by converting the A into Z according to reaction (1). An adiabatic, steady-state CSTR operating at a space time of 0.5 min is going to be used. The rate expression is given in equation (2) where the pre-exponential factor is 1.37 x 10^5^ m^3^ mol^-1^ min^-1^ and the activation energy is 11,100 cal mol^-1^. The heat of reaction is constant and equal to -7200 cal mol^-1^, and the heat capacities of A, B, I, and Z are equal to 7.6, 8.2, 4.3, and 13.8 cal mol^-1^ K^-1^, respectively. What outlet composition and temperature will result?
