This problem was adapted from the second question on the 2023 final evaluation for CE 329.

reb_12_7_2_discussion.py repeats the calculations using the inlet volumetric flow rate to calculate the concentrations. The line to write the results file is commented out so it doesn't overwrite the correct results. The results were not used because there is very small difference between the two solutions.
