Reaction (1) takes place in an adiabatic, steady state PFR using 750 dm^3^ min^-1^ of a constant-density liquid solution containing the reactant at a concentration of 3.8 mol dm^-3^ and a temperature of 25 Â°C. Pressure drop in the reactor is neglibible. The heat of reaction is -79.8 kJ mol^-1^, and may be assumed to be constant over the range of temperatures where this reactor operates. The heat capacity of the solution is equal to 987 cal L^-1^ K^-1^, independent of composition and temperature. For a conversion of 80%, compare the required PFR volume without thermal backmixing to that with thermal backmixing, assuming a simple counter-current heat exchanger with U~LM~A = 1500 kJ min^-1^ K^-1^. The rate is first order in the concentration of A, the Arrhenius pre-exponential factor is 3.38 x 10^6^ min^-1^, and the activation energy is 50 kJ mol^-1^.
