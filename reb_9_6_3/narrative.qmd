A BSTR will be charged with 1 atm of A and 2 atm of B at 25 °C. The reactor volume is 2 L, and it has a jacket with an area of 600 cm^2^ and an overall heat transfer coefficient of 0.6 cal cm^-2^ min^-1^ K^-1^. The temperature of the coolant in the perfectly-mixed jacket is maintained at 30°C by a temperature controller. Gas phase reactions (1) and (2) take place within the reactor; the corresponding rate expressions are given in equations (3) and (4). The rate coefficients display Arrhenius temperature dependence with pre-exponental factors of 3.34 x 10^9^ and 4.99 x 10^9^ mol cm^-3^ min^-1^ atm^-2^ for reactions (1) and (2), respectively, and activation energies of 20.5 and 21.8 kcal mol^-1^. The heat of reaction (1) is constant and equal to -6,300 cal mol^-1^; that of reaction (2) is constant and equal to -6,900 cal mol^-1^. The heat capacities of A, B, D, Z and U are constant and equal to 7.4, 8.6, 10.7, 5.2 and 10.3 cal mol^-1^ K^-1^, respectively.

What reaction time will maximize the yield (moles of D per initial mole of A), and what will the yield and the conversion of A equal at that reaction time?
