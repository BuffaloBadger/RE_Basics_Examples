Kinetic studies were performed at a number of different temperatures, $T$, to find the value of a second order rate coefficient, $k$, at each of the temperatures. The results for each experiment, $i$, are given in the table below. Determine whether the temperature dependence of this rate coefficient is consistent with the Arrhenius equation, and find the best values for the pre-exponential factor and the activation energy.
