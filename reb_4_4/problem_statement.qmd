Kinetic studies were performed at a number of different temperatures to find the value of a second order rate coefficient at each of the temperatures. The results are given in the table below. Determine whether the temperature dependence of this rate coefficient is consistent with the Arrhenius equation, and find the best values for the pre-exponential factor and the activation energy.
