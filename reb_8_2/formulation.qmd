I can see that this is a kinetics data analysis problem (see the expert thinking callout at the start of this section). I will start by listing the reactor type, constants provided in the problem statement, the adjusted experimental inputs, the measured experimental responses and the kinetics parameters I need to estimate.

:::

**Reactor Type**: BSTR

**Given Constants**: $V = 500\text{ cm}^3$.

**Adjusted Inputs**: $\underline{T}$, $\underline{P_{A,0}}$, $\underline{P_{B,0}}$, and $\underline{t_{rxn}}$

**Experimental Responses**: $\underline{f_{A,\text{ expt}}}$

**Kinetics Parameters**: $k_0$, and $E$

The data set includes experiments at each of 3 temperatures. From this I know that I will need to analyze the data in two phases. In the first phase I will analyzed blocks of data, each of which contains all of the experiments at one temperature. Because all of the data in a block are at the same temperature, I know that in the first phase I will only be able to estimate $k$ at each of the block temperatures. That means that in phase 1 of the analysis I will substitute $k$ for $k_0 \exp \left( \frac{-E}{RT} \right)$ in the rate expression, equation (2).

The problem statement instructs me to use a linearized reactor model. That means I must use a single mole balance on one of the products or reactants to model the reactor. (Because the reactor is isothermal, I can solve the mole balance independently of the energy balances.) The response in this problem is the fractional conversion of reagent A, so I'll write the mole balance on reagent A.

The mole balance will be a differential equation. I know that I will need to solve that IVODE analytically before I'll be able to linearize the model.

:::

**Reactor Design Equation**

A mole balance on reagent A is shown in equation (3).

$$
\frac{dn_A}{dt} = -kVP_AP_B \tag{3}
$$

Start from @eq-bstr_mole_bal_one_reaction written for reagent A.

$$
\frac{dn_i}{dt} = \nu_i r V
$$

The stoichiometric coefficient of A is -1. For this phase of the analysis, the rate expression, equation (2), is written in terms of $k$ instead of $k_0$ and $E$.

$$
r = kP_AP_B
$$

Substitution of this expression and the stoichiometric coefficient gives equation (3).

I need to solve equation (3) before I can linearize it. To do that, I need to express every variable quantity appearing in it in terms of the dependent variable, $n_A$, and the independent variable $t$. In any one experiment, $k$ and $V$ will be constant, but $P_A$ and $P_B$ will change as the reaction proceeds. Consequently, I need to express $P_A$ and $P_B$ in terms of $n_A$ and $t$.

:::

Using the ideal gas law, the partial pressures can be eliminated, equation (4).

$$
\frac{dn_A}{dt} = -kV\left( \frac{n_ART}{V} \right)\left( \frac{n_BRT}{V} \right) = \frac{-k\left(RT\right)^2}{V}n_An_B \tag{4}
$$

The molar amount of B can then be expressed in terms of the molar amount of A, equation (5).

$$
\frac{dn_A}{dt} = \frac{-k\left(RT\right)^2}{V}n_A\left( n_{B,0} - n_{A,0} + n_A \right) \tag{5}
$$

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}

Start by expressing the molar amount of reagent B in terms of its initial amount and the apparent extent of the reaction.

$$
n_B = n_{B,0} - \xi
$$

Then express $\xi$ in terms of the molar amount of reagent A.

$$
n_A = n_{A,0} - \xi \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \xi = n_{A,0} - n_A
$$

Substuting the second expression into the first gives an expression for the molar amount of reagent B.

$$
n_B = n_{B,0} - n_{A,0} + n_A
$$

Substitution of that expression into equation (4) gives equation (5).

:::

Separation of variables and integration then leads to equation (6).

$$
\frac{1}{n_{A,0}-n_{B,0}} \ln{\frac{n_{A,0}\left( n_{B,0} - n_{A,0} + n_A  \right)}{n_{B,0}n_A}} = \frac{-k\left(RT\right)^2}{V} t\tag{6}
$$

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Click Here to See Where That Came From

Rearrange equation (5) so only $n_A$ appears on the left side and only $t$ appears on the right.

$$
\frac{dn_A}{n_A\left( n_{B,0} - n_{A,0} + n_A \right)} = \frac{-k\left(RT\right)^2}{V}dt
$$

Then integrate noting that at $t=0$, $n_A = n_{A,0}$, at any later time, $t$, the molar amount of reagent A is $n_A$, and $k$, $R$, $T$, and $V$ are constants that can be taken outside of the integral.

$$
\int_{n_{A,0}}^{n_A}\frac{dn_A}{n_A\left( n_{B,0} - n_{A,0} + n_A \right)} = \frac{-k\left(RT\right)^2}{V}\int_{t_0}^tdt
$$

$$
\frac{1}{n_{B,0}-n_{A,0}} \left(\ln{\frac{ n_{B,0} - n_{A,0} + n_A  }{n_A}}\right)\Bigg\vert_{n_{A,0}}^{n_A} = \frac{-k\left(RT\right)^2}{V} t\Big\vert_{t_0}^t
$$

Evaluating at the upper and lower limits and taking the difference on each side then yields equation (6).

Looking at equation (6), I can see that the first fraction will become infinite if $n_{A,0} = n_{B,0}$, and some of the experiments have equal initial partial pressures of reagents A and B. If $n_{A,0} = n_{B,0}$ then $n_A$ will equal $n_B$ at all times because one A is consumed every time one B is consumed in the reaction. In this case, the rate expression becomes $r=kP_A^2$, so the reactor model is as follows.

$$
\frac{dn_A}{dt} = -kVP_A^2
$$

Rearrange so only $n_A$ appears on the left side and only $t$ appears on the right.

$$
\frac{dn_A}{n_A^2} = \frac{-k\left(RT\right)^2}{V}dt
$$

Then integrate noting that at $t=0$, $n_A = n_{A,0}$, at any later time, $t$, the molar amount of reagent A is $n_A$, and $k$, $R$, $T$, and $V$ are constants that can be taken outside of the integral.

$$
\int_{n_{A,0}}^{n_A}\frac{dn_A}{n_A^2} = \frac{-k\left(RT\right)^2}{V}\int_{t_0}^tdt
$$

$$
\frac{-1}{n_A}\Bigg\vert_{n_{A,0}}^{n_A} = \frac{-k\left(RT\right)^2}{V} t\Big\vert_{t_0}^t
$$

Evaluating at the upper and lower limits and taking the difference on each side then yields equation (7), below.

:::

If $n_{A,0} = n_{B,0}$, separation of variables and integration leads to equation (7).

$$
\frac{1}{n_{A,0}} - \frac{1}{n_A} = \frac{-k\left(RT\right)^2}{V} t\tag{7}
$$

## Note

Someone just starting to learn about kinetic data analysis might not have noticed that the initial fraction in equation (6) will become infinite if $n_{A,0} = n_{B,0}$. In that case, the analysis would have failed a little later, indicating that something was wrong. Eventually the new learner might figure out the problem, but this is one of those times when a little prior experience (or the ability to ask a teacher has such experience) really helps.

Having solved the mole balance ODE, the next step is to linearize it. In this problem nothing needs to be done. It is already linear. That means that I next need to calculate the values of $x$ and $y$ for each experimental data point.

:::

If $y$ is defined as shown in equation (8) for experiments where $n_{A,0} = n_{B,0}$, or as shown in equation (9) when $n_{A,0} \ne n_{B,0}$, and $x$ is defined as shown in equation (10), it can be seen that the model for both cases is a linear equation with a slope equal to $k$, equation (11).

$$
y = \frac{1}{n_{A,0}} - \frac{1}{n_A} \tag{8}
$$

$$
y = \frac{1}{n_{B,0}-n_{A,0}} \ln{\frac{n_{A,0}\left( n_{B,0} - n_{A,0} + n_A  \right)}{n_{B,0}n_A}} \tag{9}
$$

$$
x = \frac{-t\left(RT\right)^2}{V} \tag{10}
$$

$$
y=kx \tag{11}
$$

**Ancillary Equations**

The value of $x$ can be calculated for each data point using the information provided in the problem statement. In order to calculate $y$, the initial molar amounts of A and B and the final molar amount of A must be calculated. The initial amounts can be found using the ideal gas law, equations (10) and (11). The final molar amount of reagent A can then be found using the measured conversion of A, equation (12).

$$
n_{A,0} = \frac{P_{A,0}V}{RT} \tag{10}
$$

$$
n_{B,0} = \frac{P_{B,0}V}{RT} \tag{11}
$$

$$
n_A = n_{A,0} \left( 1 - f_A \right) \tag{12}
$$

The next step in this phase of the analysis is to fit equation (9) to the $x$ - $y$ data that I just calculated. I can do this using a spreadsheet or using software for linear regression. Once equation (9) has been fit to the data for each of the three temperatures, I can generate model plots as described in @sec-chapter7.

Equation (9) was fit separately to the data in each of the three constant-temperature blocks. The results are shown in @tbl-example_8_2_phase_1_results. The model plots shown in @fig-example_8_2_model_plots were then created.

Model Plots for each of the three temperature blocks.
:::

The 95% confidence intervals for each of the three estimated rate coefficients are very small compared to the estimated values and the $R^2$ values are almost equal to 1. The magnitude of the deviations are acceptable of the data points from the model line in the model plots is also small and random. All of these observations suggest that the rate expression is very accurate with respect to the composition dependence of the rate.

At this point I have completed the first phase of the analysis, and I know that the second phase of the analysis involves fitting the Arrhenius expression to the results I just obtained. I've done this enough times now that I know to use the linearized Arrhenius expression where $x=\frac{-1}{RT}$ and $y=\ln{k}$ and that the resulting slope will equal the activation energy and the intercept will equal $\ln{k_0}$. (See [Example -@sec-example_4_4], [Example -@sec-example_8_1], and @sec-rates-rate-express.)

:::

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
library(tidyverse)
source("~/Libraries/R/fmt_tibble_col.R")
d <- read.csv("python/reb_8_2_Arrhenius_results.csv")
d <- fmt_tibble_col(d, 2, 3, 2, 2)
a <- c('k~0~','E','R^2^')
b1 <- paste0(d$value[1],' ',d$units[1],', 95% CI [',d$value[2],', ',d$value[3],']')
b2 <- paste0(d$value[4],' ',d$units[4],', 95% CI [',d$value[5],', ',d$value[6],']')
b <- c(b1,b2,d$value[7])
 # item, value, units
d <- data.frame(a,b)
```

The Arrhenius expression was fit to the estimated rate coefficients for three four blocks with the following results.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

#| tbl-cap: Parameter estimation results

kbl(d, format = "markdown", align = "cc", col.names = NULL)
```

The 95% confidence interval for the pre-exponential factor is large. Specifically it ranges from ca. one-third of the estimated value to three times the estimated value, but a wide confidence interval is often observed for the pre-exponential factor. The confidence interval for the activation energy is small relative to its value, suggesting a good fit. Additionally, the coefficient of determination is equal to 1, which indicates a very good fit. The Arrhenius plot is shown in @fig-example_8_2_Arrhenius_plot. The estimated rate coefficients fall almost exactly on the line representing the Arrhenius expression.

![Arrhenius plot resulting from the estimated parameters.](python/reb_8_2_Arrhenius_plot.png){#fig-example_8_2_Arrhenius_plot width=80%}

**Recommendation**

The proposed rate expression given in equation (2) provides a very accurate representation of the experimental data in this study. It should be accepted with the pre-exponential factor and activation energy shown in @tbl-example_8_2_arrhenius_results.
