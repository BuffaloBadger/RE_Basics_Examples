The enzymatic dehydration of substrate S to product P, reaction (1), was studied in a 50 ml BSTR. Three experiments were performed. The temperature was the same in all three experiments, but the initial concentration of substrate S (mmol L^-1^) differed. At the start of each experiment product P was not present in the reactor. The reaction takes place in aqueous solution, so the concentration of water may be assumed to be constant. The concentration of product P (mmol L^-1^) was measured at 10 min intervals during 2 h of reaction in each of the experiments.  Use the resulting data to assess the accuracy of the Michaelis-Menten rate expression, equation (2), for this reaction.

$$
S \rightarrow P + H_2O \tag{1}
$$

$$
r = \frac{V_{max}C_S}{K_m + C_S} \tag{2}
$$
