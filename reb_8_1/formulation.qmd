## Direct Analysis of Experimental Data Using a Reactor Model

{{< include problem_statement.qmd >}}

---

**Expert Thinking** I am asked to formulate a response function that will predict the response for BSTR experiments given the adjusted reactor inputs and the necessary kinetics parameters. To do that I must first generate a reactor model as described in [Chapter 6]. Then, after solving the reactor design equations for each experiment, the final concentration of A must be calculated.

To begin, I need to write the reactor design equations for the experimental system. There are two reagents in the system, A and Z, so I will write mole balances for each of them. The reactor operates isothermally which means that the mole balances can be solved independently from the other design equations. In this problem I am not told anything about heat transfer or how the temperature was held constant during the experiments. Even if I wanted to include energy balances in the reactor model, I would not be able to because I have not been provided with enough information to write the energy balances. Additionally, the reactor is a BSTR, so I do not need a momentum balance. Therefore, for this sytesm, the reactor design equations consist of mole balances on A and Z.

**Reactor Design Equations**

$$
\frac{dn_A}{dt} = -r_1 V \tag{3}
$$

$$
\frac{dn_Z}{dt} = r_1 V \tag{4}
$$

**Solution of the Reactor Design Equations**

2 IVODEs, $t$ is independent variable, $n_A$ and $n_Z$ are dependent variables, solve for each of 72 experimental data points

**Given Constants**: $V = 1\text{ L}$.

**Known Adjusted Input and Parameters**: $T_i$, $C_{A,0,i}$, $t_i$, $k_{0.1}$, and $E_1$

**Ancillary Equations**

rate from equation (2)

$$
C_A = \frac{n_A}{V} \tag{5}
$$

**Initial Values and Stopping Criterion**

$$
n_{A,0} = C_{A,0,i}V \tag{6}
$$

| Variable | Initial Value | Stopping Criterion |
|:-------|:-------:|:-------:|
| $t$ | $0$ | $t_i$ |
| $n_A$ | $n_{A,0}$ | |
| $n_Z$ | $0$ | |

**Response Function**

$$
C_{A,i,\text{model}} = \frac{n_A \Big\vert_{t=t_i}}{V} \tag{7}
