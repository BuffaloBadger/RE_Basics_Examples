To produce Z, equation (1), reagent A will be fed to a 0.5 m^3^ adiabatic, steady state CSTR at 70 mol s^-1^ and B will be fed at 1500 mol s^-1^ giving a total feed rate of 40 L s^-1^. The rate expression is given in equation (2), where the pre-exponential factor for the rate coefficient is 1.2 x 10^9^ m^3^ mol^-1^ s^-1^ and the activation energy is 25.8 kcal mol^-1^. The equilibrium constant appearing in the rate expression can be calculated using equation (3), where the pre-exponential factor is 4.2 x 10^-18^ m^3^ mol^-1^ and the heat of reaction is -22.4 kcal mol^-1^. The heat capacities of A, B, and Z are 412, 75.5, and 512 J mol^-1^ K^-1^, respectively, and may be taken to be independent of temperature. What feed temperature will maximize the conversion of A?
