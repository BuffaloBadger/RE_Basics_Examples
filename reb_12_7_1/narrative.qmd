Reactants A and B can react irreversibly to produce either a desired product, D, or an undesired product, U, as shown in equations (1) and (2). The corresponding rate expressions are given in equations (3) and (4). The pre-exponential factors for $k_1$ and $k_2$ are 10.2 gal mol^-1^ min^-1^ and 17.0 gal mol^-1^ min^-1^, respectively, and the activation energies are 15.3 kJ mol^-1^ and 23.7 kJ mol^-1^, respectively. A liquid mixture containing 10 mol A gal^-1^ and 12 mol B gal^-1^ at 350 K is fed to an adiabatic 25 gal CSTR at a rate of 12.5 gal min^-1^. If the standard heats at 298 K of reactions (1) and (2) are -12.0 and -21.3 kJ mol^-1^, respectively, and if the reagents form an ideal liquid mixture with the temperature-independent heat capacities of A, B, D and U equal to 85, 125, 200 and 170 J mol^-1^ K^-1^, what are the conversion of the limiting reagent, the outlet selectivity (in mol D per mol U) and the outlet temperature?
