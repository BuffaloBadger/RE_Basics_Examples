Suppose the non-elementary reaction (1) is heterogeneously catalyzed, and the corresponding reaction mechanism is given by equations (2) through (6). Assume step (4) is rate-determining and derive an expression for the apparent rate of reaction (1) that does not include fractional coverages.

$$
A + B \rightleftarrows C + D \tag{1}
$$

$$
A + \ast \rightleftarrows A\!-\!\ast \tag{2}
$$

$$
B + \ast \rightleftarrows B\!-\!\ast \tag{3}
$$

$$
A\!-\!\ast + B\!-\!\ast \rightarrow C\!-\!\ast + D\!-\!\ast \tag{4}
$$

$$
C\!-\!\ast \rightleftarrows C + \ast \tag{5}
$$

$$
D\!-\!\ast \rightleftarrows D + \ast \tag{6}
$$
