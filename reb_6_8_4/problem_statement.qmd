Liquid-phase reaction (1) takes place in an ideal steady-state CSTR. It is exothermic and reversible. The rate expression is given in equation (2) where $K_1$ is the concentration equilibrium constant for reaction (1). The feed is a solution containing A and B at concentrations of $C_{A,in}$ and $C_{B,in}$. There is no Z in the feed. The volumetric feed flow rate is $\dot V_{in}$ and the feed temperature is $T_{in}$. The reactor volume is $V$ and it operates at a pressure, $P$. Saturated steam at $T_{ex}$ condenses in the reactor jacket which has a volume, $V_{ex}$, heat transfer area, $A$, and heat transfer coefficient, $U$.

$$
A + B \rightarrow Z \tag{1}
$$

$$
r_1 = k_1 C_A C_B \left( 1 - \frac{C_Z}{K_1 C_A C_B} \right) \tag{2}
$$

Write and simplify the reactor design equations needed to model this system, including any associated initial values and stopping criterion.
