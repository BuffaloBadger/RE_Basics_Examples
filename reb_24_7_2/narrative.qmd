Example 24.7.1 showed that when $D_{ax}$ = 1.0 and $\lambda_{ax}$ = 1.0 x 10^6^, the response predicted by the axial dispersion model is essentially that of a CSTR, and when $D_{ax}$ = 1.0 x 10^-5^ and $\lambda_{ax}$ = 1.0 x 10^1^, the response predicted by the axial dispersion model is essentially that of a PFR. Repeat the analysis of Example 24.7.1 using the combinations of $D_{ax}$ and $\lambda_{ax}$ in @tbl-example_24_7_2_data to examine the effect of varying the dispersion coefficients individually. The first seven rows in the table individually vary the dispersion paramters from the values that correspond to a CSTR and the last seven vary the dispersion parameters from the values that correspond to a PFR.
