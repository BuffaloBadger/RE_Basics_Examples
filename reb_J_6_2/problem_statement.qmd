This is not an example of a reactor analysis; it simply illustrates how to solve a set of IVODEs when one of the initial values is unknown. Equations (1) through (3) are representative of the IVODEs an engineer might need to solve when analyzing an adiabatic, steady-state PFR with negligible pressure drop. Suppose the engineer needs to calculate the initial value of $T$, $T_{in}$, that will result in a specified final value of $T$, $T_{out}$, and then calculate $\dot{n}_A\left(z\right)$, $\dot{n}_Z\left(z\right)$, and $T\left(z\right)$ using $T_{in}$. For this example, assume that the engineer knows that equation (4) is the rate expression, and that $D$ = 1 in, $k_0$ = 7.49 x 10^9^ L mol^-1^ min^-1^, $E$ = 15,300 cal mol^-1^, $P$ = 4 atm, $\Delta H$ = -14,500 cal mol^-1^, $\hat{C}_{p,A}$ = 10.9 cal mol^-1^ K^-1^, $\hat{C}_{p,Z}$ = 21.8 cal mol^-1^ K^-1^, $L$ = 100 in, $\dot{n}_{A,in}$ = 1.5 mol min^-1^, $\dot{n}_{Z,in}$ = 0, and $T_{out}$ = 400 K.

$$
\frac{d\dot{n}_A}{dz} = -2\frac{\pi D^2}{4}r \tag{1}
$$

$$
\frac{d\dot{n}_Z}{dz} = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}r \tag{2}
$$

$$
\frac{dT}{dz} = -\frac{\pi D^2}{4}\frac{r\Delta H}{\dot{n}_A \hat{C}_{p,A} + \dot{n}_Z \hat{C}_{p,Z}} \tag{3}
$$

$$
r = k_0exp{\left( \frac{-E}{RT}\right)} \left(\frac{\dot{n}_AP}{\left( \dot{n}_A + \dot{n}_Z\right)RT}\right)^2 \tag{4}
$$
