A jacketed, 10 L BSTR is going to be used to process an aqueous solution of A and B. The reactor jacket is perfectly mixed with a volume of 1400 cm^3^, a heat transfer coefficient of 138 cal ft^−2^ min^−1^ K^−1^ and a heat transfer area of 1200 cm^2^. Cooling water at 40 °C flows into the jacket at a rate of 100 g min^-1^. Both the reacting fluid and the cooling water may be taken to have a density of 1 g cm^−3^ and a heat capacity of 1 cal g^−1^ K^−1^. 

Solutions of A and B are ideal and there is no heat of mixing. The reactor will be charbed by mixing two separate solutions, one containing only reagent A and the other containing only reagent B, giving a 10 L charge with initial concentrations of 5 mol A L^-1^ and 7 mol B L^-1^. Reactions (1) and (2) will occur in the reactor. The heat of reaction (1) is −16.7 kcal mol^−1^, and that for reaction (2) is −14.3 kcal mol^−1^. The rate expression for reaction (1) is given in equation (3) where the pre-exponential factor is 9.74 x 10^9^ L mol^−1^ min^−1^ and the activation energy is 20.1 kcal mol^−1^. The rate expression for reaction (2) is given in equation (4) where the pre-exponential factor is 2.38 x 10^13^ min^−1^ and the activation energy is 25.3 kcal mol^−1^.

What initial temperature is needed in order to convert 45% of the A in 30 min, and with that initial temperature what will the final temperature, the outlet exchange fluid temperature, and selectivity of X to Z equal?

$$
A + B \rightarrow X + Y \tag{1}
$$

$$
A \rightarrow Z \tag{2}
$$

$$
r_1 = k_1C_AC_B \tag{3}
$$

$$
r_2 = k_2C_A \tag{4}
$$
