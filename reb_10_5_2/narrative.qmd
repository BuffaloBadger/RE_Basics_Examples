The rate expressions for reactions (1) and (2) are shown in equations (3) and (4). The Arrhenuis parameters for these reactions are $k_{0,1}$ = 1.83 x 10^12^ L mol^-1^ h^-1^, $E_1$ = 18.0 kcal mol^-1^, $k_{0,2}$ = 5.08 x 10^13^ L mol^-1^ h^-1^, and $E_2$ = 20.5 kcal mol^-1^,  Reagent D is the desired product while reagent U is undesired. The heats of reactions (1) and (2) are -9000 and -7800 cal mol^-1^, respectively. Solutions of A and B have a heat capacity of 863 cal L^-1^ K^-1^. A 2 M solution of A and a 0.5 M solution of B, both at 40 Â°C, are going to be used to produce D in an adiabatic semi-batch reactor operating at 1 atm. The reactor will be charged with 2000 L of the A solution, and 8000 L of the B solution will be added at a constant rate over a period of time. If the total reaction time is always 8 h, compare the overall conversion of B and the yield of D from B (final moles of D per total moles of B added to the reactor) if the solution of B is added over the first 1, 3, 5, or 7 hours of operation.
