The rate expression for liquid-phase reaction (1) is given in equation (2). The rate coefficient displays Arrhenius temperature dependence with a pre-exponential factor of 2.59 x 10^9^ min^-1^ and an activation energy of 16.5 kcal mol^-1^. The heat of reaction (1) may be taken to be constant and equal to -22,200 cal mol^-1^. A solution containing only A at a concentration of 2 M and a temperature of 23 Â°C is going to be processed in a BSTR. The heat capacity of the solution is approximately constant and equal to 440 cal L^-1^ K^-1^, and its density is constant.
