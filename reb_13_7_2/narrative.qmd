A perfectly insulated tubular reactor with a diameter of 10 cm and a length of 5 m is fed an aqueous solution containing A and B at concentrations of 1.0 and 1.2 M, respectively. This feed stream flows at 75 L min-1. Reagents A and B react according to reaction (1) with a rate of reaction that is accurately described by equation (2). The rate coefficient displays Arrhenius temperature dependence with a pre-exponential factor equal to 8.72 x 10^5^ L mol^-1^ min^-1^ and an activation energy of 7200 cal mol^-1^. The heat of reaction (1) is -10,700 cal mol-1 and may be assumed to be constant. The heat capacity of the solution and the density of the solution may be taken to be constant and equal to those of water (1.0 cal g-1 K-1 and 1.0 g cm-3). The pressure drop in the reactor is negligible. What feed temperature is needed in order to convert 95% of the A, and what will the outlet temperature be?
