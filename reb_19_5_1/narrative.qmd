Kinetics data for liquid-phase reaction (1) were generated using an ideal, isothermal, 1 L BSTR. The reaction is irreversible, and preliminary analysis indicated that the rate is not affected by the concentration of the product, Z. The experimental design used the initial concentration of A and the temperature as factors. Twelve experiments were performed wherein the temperature and initial concentration of reagent A were set after which the concentration of reagent A was measured at six reaction times, giving a set of 72 experimental data points. The rate expression shown in equation (2) has been proposed for this reaction. The rate coefficient in equation (2) is expected to display Arrhenius temperature dependence. Determine the best values for the Arrhenius pre-exponential factor and activation energy and assess the accuracy of the proposed first order rate expression.
